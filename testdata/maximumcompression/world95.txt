The 1995 CIA World Factbook

June, 1996 [Etext #571]


**The Project Gutenberg Etext of the 1995 CIA World Factbook**
*****This file should be named world95.txt or world95.zip*****

Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, world951.txt.
VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, world95a.txt.


This etext was created by Dr. Gregory B. Newby.  Newby works as
faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, home
town to Project Gutenberg.  This etext is based entirely on the
version made available by the print publishers, and was derived
from files accessed at the World Wide Web site, except for some
image files (maps) as described at the etext appendix.  The WWW
address is: http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/95fact/.


We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance
of the official release dates, for time for better editing.

Please note:  neither this list nor its contents are final till
midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
The official release date of all Project Gutenberg Etexts is at
Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month.  A
preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment
and editing by those who wish to do so.  To be sure you have an
up to date first edition [xxxxx10x.xxx] please check file sizes
in the first week of the next month.  Since our ftp program has
a bug in it that scrambles the date [tried to fix and failed] a
look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a
new copy has at least one byte more or less.


Information about Project Gutenberg (one page)

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.  The
fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text
files per month:  or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the
total should reach 80 billion Etexts.

The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  [10,000 x 100,000,000=Trillion]
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.  2001
should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it
will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

**Information prepared by the Project Gutenberg legal advisor**
(Three Pages)


***START**THE SMALL PRINT!**FOR PUBLIC DOMAIN ETEXTS**START***
Why is this "Small Print!" statement here?  You know: lawyers.
They tell us you might sue us if there is something wrong with
your copy of this etext, even if you got it for free from
someone other than us, and even if what's wrong is not our
fault.  So, among other things, this "Small Print!" statement
disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

*BEFORE!* YOU USE OR READ THIS ETEXT
By using or reading any part of this PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etext, you indicate that you understand, agree to and accept
this "Small Print!" statement.  If you do not, you can receive
a refund of the money (if any) you paid for this etext by
sending a request within 30 days of receiving it to the person
you got it from.  If you received this etext on a physical
medium (such as a disk), you must return it with your request.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS
This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-
tm etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association at
Illinois Benedictine College (the "Project").  Among other
things, this means that no one owns a United States copyright
on or for this work, so the Project (and you!) can copy and
distribute it in the United States without permission and
without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules, set forth
below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute this etext
under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable
efforts to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain
works.  Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any
medium they may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other
things, Defects may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged
disk or other etext medium, a computer virus, or computer
codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.

LIMITED WARRANTY; DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES
But for the "Right of Replacement or Refund" described below,
[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this
etext from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including
legal fees, and [2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR
UNDER STRICT LIABILITY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT,
INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any)
you paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that
time to the person you received it from.  If you received it
on a physical medium, you must return it with your note, and
such person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement
copy.  If you received it electronically, such person may
choose to alternatively give you a second opportunity to
receive it electronically.

THIS ETEXT IS OTHERWISE PROVIDED TO YOU "AS-IS".  NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, ARE MADE TO YOU AS
TO THE ETEXT OR ANY MEDIUM IT MAY BE ON, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Some states do not allow disclaimers of implied warranties or
the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you
may have other legal rights.

INDEMNITY
You will indemnify and hold the Project, its directors,
officers, members and agents harmless from all liability, cost
and expense, including legal fees, that arise directly or
indirectly from any of the following that you do or cause:
[1] distribution of this etext, [2] alteration, modification,
or addition to the etext, or [3] any Defect.

DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm"
You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this
"Small Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg,
or:

[1]  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this
     requires that you do not remove, alter or modify the
     etext or this "small print!" statement.  You may however,
     if you wish, distribute this etext in machine readable
     binary, compressed, mark-up, or proprietary form,
     including any form resulting from conversion by word pro-
     cessing or hypertext software, but only so long as
     *EITHER*:

     [*]  The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable, and
          does *not* contain characters other than those
          intended by the author of the work, although tilde
          (~), asterisk (*) and underline (_) characters may
          be used to convey punctuation intended by the
          author, and additional characters may be used to
          indicate hypertext links; OR

     [*]  The etext may be readily converted by the reader at
          no expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent
          form by the program that displays the etext (as is
          the case, for instance, with most word processors);
          OR

     [*]  You provide, or agree to also provide on request at
          no additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the
          etext in its original plain ASCII form (or in EBCDIC
          or other equivalent proprietary form).

[2]  Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

[3]  Pay a trademark license fee to the Project of 20% of the
     net profits you derive calculated using the method you
     already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  If you
     don't derive profits, no royalty is due.  Royalties are
     payable to "Project Gutenberg Association / Illinois
     Benedictine College" within the 60 days following each
     date you prepare (or were legally required to prepare)
     your annual (or equivalent periodic) tax return.

WHAT IF YOU *WANT* TO SEND MONEY EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO?
The Project gratefully accepts contributions in money, time,
scanning machines, OCR software, public domain etexts, royalty
free copyright licenses, and every other sort of contribution
you can think of.  Money should be paid to "Project Gutenberg
Association / Illinois Benedictine College".

                 NOTES, DEFINITIONS, AND ABBREVIATIONS

There have been some significant changes in this edition. The Trust
Territory of the Pacific Islands became the independent nation of
Palau. The gross domestic product (GDP) of all countries is now
presented on a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis rather than on the
old exchange rate basis. There is a new entry on Age structure and the
Airports entry now includes unpaved runways. The Communications
category has been restructured and now includes the entries of
Telephone system, Radio, and Television. The remainder of the entries
in the former Communications category-Railroads, Highways, Inland
waterways, Pipelines, Ports, Merchant marine, and Airports-can now be
found under a new category called Transportation. There is a new
appendix listing estimates of gross domestic product on an exchange
rate basis for all nations. A reference map of the Republic of South
Africa is included. The electronic files used to produce the Factbook
have been restructured into a database. As a result, the formats of
some entries in this edition have been changed. Additional changes
will occur in the 1996 Factbook.

Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and
first-order administrative divisions are generally those approved by
the US Board on Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been
reported but not yet acted on by BGN are noted.

Airports: Only airports with usable runways are included in this
listing. For airports with more than one runway, only the longest
runway is included. Not all airports have facilities for refueling,
maintenance, or air traffic control. Paved runways have concrete or
asphalt surfaces; unpaved runways have grass, dirt, sand, or gravel
surfaces.

Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by
international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate
of all surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or
coastlines, excluding inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers).
Comparative areas are based on total area equivalents. Most entities
are compared with the entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller
entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km, 69 sq mi) or The
Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres).

Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per
1,000 population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. Dates of
information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1995 is
used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are
estimates for 1 July 1995, with population growth rates estimated for
calendar year 1995. Major political events have been updated through
April 1995.

Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per
l,000 population at midyear; also known as crude death rate.

Digraphs: The digraph is a two-letter "country code" that precisely
identifies every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF,
for example, is the digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized
geopolitical data element promulgated in the Federal Information
Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 10-3 by the National Bureau of
Standards (now called National Institute of Standards and Technology)
at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the Office of the
Geographer at the US Department of State. The digraph is used to
eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing,
and dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful for
interchanging data between databases.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations
with 184 nations, including 178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN
members are Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia,
and the US itself). In addition, the US has diplomatic relations with
6 nations that are not in the UN - Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru,
Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu.

Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official
development assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is
defined as financial assistance which is concessional in character,
has the main objective to promote economic development and welfare of
LDCs, and contains a grant element of at least 25%. OOF transactions
are also official government assistance, but with a main objective
other than development and with a grant element less than 25%. OOF
transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank
credits), official equity and portfolio investment, and debt
reorganization by the official sector that does not meet concessional
terms. Aid is considered to have been committed when agreements are
initialed by the parties involved and constitute a formal declaration
of intent.

Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special
sovereignty, and governments included in this publication are not
independent, and others are not officially recognized by the US
Government. "Nation" refers to a people politically organized into a
sovereign state with a definite territory. "Dependent area" refers to
a broad category of political entities that are associated in some way
with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually the short-form
names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are 266
entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

184 -- UN members (excluding the former Yugoslavia, which is still
    counted by the UN)

The official value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or over
a given period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US
dollar and as determined by international market forces or official
fiat.

GDP methodology: In the "Economy" section, GDP dollar estimates for
all countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP)
calculations rather than from conversions at official currency
exchange rates. The PPP method normally involves the use of
international dollar price weights, which are applied to the
quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In
addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries,
the statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying,
and allowing for the quality of goods and services. The division of a
GDP estimate in local currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in
dollars gives the PPP conversion rate. On average, one thousand
dollars will buy the same market basket of goods in the US as one
thousand dollars - converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate - will buy in the other country. Whereas PPP estimates
for OECD countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing
countries are often rough approximations. Most of the GDP estimates
are based on extrapolation of numbers published by the UN
International Comparison Program and by Professors Robert Summers and
Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their colleagues.
Currency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and
domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic
output. In developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate
estimate of GDP in dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP
estimate. Furthermore, exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by
10% or more because of market forces or official fiat whereas real
output has remained unchanged. On 12 January 1994, for example, the 14
countries of the African Financial Community (whose currencies are
tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 50%. This move,
of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by half. One
important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a
percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially
from the proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as,
for example, when an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of
Russian or Japanese military expenditures. Note: The numbers for GDP
and other economic data can not be chained together from successive
volumes of the Factbook because of changes in the US dollar measuring
rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of new or
different sources of information, and changes in national statistical
methods and practices.

Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year.

Gross national product (GNP): The value of all final goods and
services produced within a nation in a given year, plus income earned
abroad, minus income earned by foreigners from domestic production.

Gross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and
services produced worldwide in a given year.

Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population,
resulting from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the
balance of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be
positive or negative.

Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs - narcotics,
stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis.
These categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by
doctors as well as those illegally produced and sold outside medical
channels.
Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana
(pot, Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC,
Marinol), hashish (hash), and hashish oil (hash oil).
Coca (Erythroxylum coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the
stimulant used to make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa,
which comes from cacao seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa,
and cocoa butter.
Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush.
Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and
include chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal,
phenobarbital), benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone
(Quaalude), glutethimide (Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl,
Valmid). Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical,
mental, emotional, or behavioral change in an individual. Drug abuse
is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in
physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an
individual. Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking,
self-awareness, and emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid,
microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc, buttons, cactus), amphetamine
variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, angel dust, hog),
phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others (psilocybin,
psilocyn).
Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant
(Cannabis sativa).
Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine.
Mandrax is the Southwest Asian slang term for methaqualone, a
pharmaceutical depressant.
Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis
sativa).
Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, in slang referred to as
Quaaludes in North America or Mandrax in Southwest Asia Narcotics are
drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium, opium
derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include
opium (paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol),
codeine (Tylenol with codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC),
and thebaine. Semisynthetic narcotics include heroin (horse, smack),
and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic narcotics include meperidine
or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone (Dolophine, Methadose),
and others (Darvon, Lomotil).
Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium
poppy. Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural
and semisynthetic narcotics. Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid
derived from the mature dried opium poppy.
Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of catha edulis
that is chewed or drunk as tea.
Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a
pharmaceutical depressant.
Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and
activity, and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines
(Desoxyn, Dexedrine), phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate
(Ritalin), and others (Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate).

Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year
old in a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.

International disputes: This category includes a wide variety of
situations that range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to
unilateral claims of one sort or another. Information regarding
disputes over international boundaries and maritime boundaries has
been reviewed by the Department of State. References to other
situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such
as resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues.
However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance
or recognition by the US Government.

Irrigated land: The figure refers to the land area that is
artificially supplied with water.

Land use: The land surface is categorized as arable land - land
cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat,
maize, rice); permanent crops - land cultivated for crops that are not
replanted after each harvest (citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and
pastures - land permanently used for herbaceous forage crops; forest
and woodland - under dense or open stands of trees; and other - any
land type not specifically mentioned above (urban areas, roads,
desert).

Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who
represents the state at official and ceremonial functions but is not
involved with the day- to-day activities of the government. The head
of government is the administrative leader who manages the day-to-day
activities of the government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of
state, and the Prime Minister is the head of government. In the US,
the President is both the chief of state and the head of government.

Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a
group of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age
remains constant in the future.

Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of
literacy. Unless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most
common definition - the ability to read and write at a specified age.
Detailing the standards that individual countries use to assess the
ability to read and write is beyond the scope of this publication.

Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some
national claims from being extended the full distance.

Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All
commercial vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which
excludes tugs, fishing vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a
grouping of merchant ships by nationality or register.
Captive register - A register of ships maintained by a territory,
possession, or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships
owned in the parent country; also referred to as an offshore register,
the offshore equivalent of an internal register. Ships on a captive
register will fly the same flag as the parent country, or a local
variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime laws and taxation
rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a captive
register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent
country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned
abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.
Flag of convenience register - A national register offering
registration to a merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major
flags of convenience (FOC) attract ships to their registers by virtue
of low fees, low or nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal
manning requirements. True FOC registers are characterized by having
relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in the flag
state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a
given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority
of the merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an
open register.
Flag state - The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds
legal jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or
abroad. Flag state maritime legislation determines how a ship is
manned and taxed and whether a foreign-owned ship may be placed on the
register.
Internal register - A register of ships maintained as a subset of a
national register. Ships on the internal register fly the national
flag and have that nationality but are subject to a separate set of
maritime rules from those on the main national register. These
differences usually include lower taxation of profits, manning by
foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag state
(when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most
notable examples of an internal register. Both have been instrumental
in stemming flight from the national flag to flags of convenience and
in attracting foreign owned ships to the Norwegian and Danish flags.
Merchant ship - A vessel that carries goods against payment of
freight; commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately
restricted to commercial vessels only.
Register - The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed
with the maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of
such individual ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides
it with a nationality and makes it subject to the laws of the country
in which registered (the flag state) regardless of the nationality of
the ship's ultimate owner.

Money figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US
dollars unless otherwise indicated.

National product: The total output of goods and services in a country
in a given year. See GDP methodology, Gross domestic product (GDP),
and Gross national product (GNP).

Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering
and leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on
midyear population). An excess of persons entering the country is
referred to as net immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an
excess of persons leaving the country as net emigration (-9.26
migrants/1,000 population).

Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based
on statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration
systems, or sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on
assumptions about future trends. Starting with the 1993 Factbook,
demographic estimates for some countries (mostly African) have taken
into account the effects of the growing incidence of AIDS infections;
in 1993 these countries were Burkina, Burundi, Central African
Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania,
Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Brazil, and Haiti.

Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers presented in the Factbook
consist of the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where
required) in parentheses, and the local number. The one component that
is not presented is the international access code which varies from
country to country. For example, an international direct dial phone
call placed from the United States to Madrid, Spain, would be as
follows:

    011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where
    011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls
    (01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls),
    [34] is the country code for Spain,
    (1) is the city code for Madrid,
    577 is the local exchange,
    and xxxx is the local telephone number.
    
An international direct dial phone call placed from another country to
the United States would be as follows:

international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx where
    [1] is the country code for the United States,
    (202) is the area code for Washington, DC,
    939 is the local exchange,
    and xxxx is the local telephone number.

Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be
born per woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing
years and bore children according to a given fertility rate at each
age. Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless
indicated as fiscal year (FY). FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that
began in calendar year 1993 and ended in calendar year 1994 as defined
in the Fiscal Year entry of the Economy section for each nation.
FY90-94 refers to the four fiscal years that began in calendar year
1990 and ended in calendar year 1994.

Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from
material in the public domain and does not represent Intelligence
Community estimates. The Handbook of International Economic
Statistics, published annually in September by the Central
Intelligence Agency, contains detailed economic information for the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)
countries, Eastern Europe, the newly independent republics of the
former nations of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and selected other
countries. The Handbook can be obtained wherever The World Factbook is
available.

Economy

 Overview: An extremely poor country by European standards, Albania is
 making the difficult transition to a more open-market economy. The
 economy rebounded in 1993-94 after a severe depression accompanying
 the collapse of the previous centrally planned system in 1990 and
 1991. Stabilization policies - including a strict monetary policy,
 public sector layoffs, and reduced social services - have improved the
 government's fiscal situation and reduced inflation. The recovery was
 spurred by the remittances of some 20% of the population which works
 abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These remittances supplement GDP
 and help offset the large foreign trade deficit. Foreign assistance
 and humanitarian aid also supported the recovery. Most agricultural
 land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant incomes.
 Albania's limited industrial sector, now less than one-sixth of GDP,
 continued to decline in 1994. A sharp fall in chromium prices reduced
 hard currency receipts from the mining sector. Large segments of the
 population, especially those living in urban areas, continue to depend
 on humanitarian aid to meet basic food requirements. Unemployment
 remains a severe problem accounting for approximately one-fifth of the
 work force. Growth is expected to continue in 1995, but could falter
 if Albania becomes involved in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia,
 workers' remittances from Greece are reduced, or foreign assistance
 declines.

Economy

 Overview: The hydrocarbons sector is the backbone of the economy,
 accounting for roughly 57% of government revenues, 25% of GDP, and
 almost all export earnings; Algeria has the fifth largest reserves of
 natural gas in the world and ranks fourteenth for oil. Algiers'
 efforts to reform one of the most centrally planned economies in the
 Arab world began after the 1986 collapse of world oil prices plunged
 the country into a severe recession. In 1989, the government launched
 a comprehensive, IMF-supported program to achieve macroeconomic
 stabilization and to introduce market mechanisms into the economy.
 Despite substantial progress toward macroeconomic adjustment, in 1992
 the reform drive stalled as Algiers became embroiled in political
 turmoil. In September 1993, a new government was formed, and one
 priority was the resumption and acceleration of the structural
 adjustment process. Buffeted by the slump in world oil prices and
 burdened with a heavy foreign debt, Algiers concluded a one-year
 standby arrangement with the IMF in April 1994.

Economy

 Overview: Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's economy, accounts for
 roughly 80% of GDP. An estimated 13 million tourists visit annually,
 attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its summer and winter
 resorts. The banking sector, with its "tax haven" status, also
 contributes substantially to the economy. Agricultural production is
 limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most food has to be
 imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising.
 Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture.
 Andorra is a member of the EU Customs Union; it is unclear what effect
 the European Single Market will have on the advantages Andorra obtains
 from its duty-free status.

@Angola:Government

 Note: Civil war has been the norm since independence from Portugal on
 11 November 1975; a cease-fire lasted from 31 May 1991 until October
 1992 when the insurgent National Union for the Total Independence of
 Angola (UNITA) refused to accept its defeat in internationally
 monitored elections and fighting resumed throughout much of the
 countryside. The two sides signed another peace accord on 20 November
 1994; the cease-fire is generally holding but most provisions of the
 accord remain to be implemented.

Economy

 Overview: Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for
 80%-90% of the population but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil
 production is vital to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP.
 Despite the signing of a peace accord in November 1994 between the
 Angola government and the UNITA insurgents, sporadic fighting
 continues and many farmers remain reluctant to return to their fields.
 As a result, much of the country's food requirements must still be
 imported. Angola has rich natural resources - notably gold, diamonds,
 and arable land, in addition to large oil deposits - but will need to
 observe the cease-fire, implement the peace agreement, and reform
 government policies if it is to achieve its potential.

@Antarctica:Geography

 Location: continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle

 Map references: Antarctic Region

 Area:
 total area: 14 million sq km (est.)
 land area: 14 million sq km (est.)
 comparative area: slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US
 note: second-smallest continent (after Australia)

 Land boundaries: none, but see entry on International disputes

 Coastline: 17,968 km

 Maritime claims: none, but see entry on International Disputes

 International disputes: Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic
 Treaty Summary below); sections (some overlapping) claimed by
 Argentina, Australia, Chile, France (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross
 Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and UK; the US and most other
 nations do not recognize the territorial claims of other nations and
 have made no claims themselves (the US reserves the right to do so);
 no formal claims have been made in the sector between 90 degrees west
 and 150 degrees west

 Climate: severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and
 distance from the ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West
 Antarctica because of its higher elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has
 the most moderate climate; higher temperatures occur in January along
 the coast and average slightly below freezing

 Terrain: about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock,
 with average elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain
 ranges up to 4,897 meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts
 of southern Victoria Land, Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area,
 and parts of Ross Island on McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves
 along about half of the coastline, and floating ice shelves constitute
 11% of the area of the continent

 Natural resources: none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium,
 copper, gold, nickel, platinum and other minerals, and coal and
 hydrocarbons have been found in small, uncommercial quantities

 Land use:
 arable land: 0%
 permanent crops: 0%
 meadows and pastures: 0%
 forest and woodland: 0%
 other: 100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%)

 Irrigated land: 0 sq km

 Environment:
 current issues: in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield,
 which protects the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation,
 had dwindled to the lowest level recorded over Antarctica since 1975
 when measurements were first taken
 natural hazards: katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
 the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the
 plateau; cyclonic storms form over the ocean and move clockwise along
 the coast; volcanism on Deception Island and isolated areas of West
 Antarctica; other seismic activity rare and weak
 international agreements: NA

 Note: the coldest, windiest, highest, and driest continent; during
 summer more solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than
 is received at the Equator in an equivalent period; mostly
 uninhabitable

 Type:
 Antarctic Treaty Summary: The Antarctic Treaty, signed on 1 December
 1959 and entered into force on 23 June 1961, establishes the legal
 framework for the management of Antarctica. Administration is carried
 out through consultative member meetings - the 18th Antarctic Treaty
 Consultative Meeting was in Japan in April 1993. Currently, there are
 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and 16 acceding.
 Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim
 portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and
 19 nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made
 no claims have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize
 the claims of others. The year in parentheses indicates when an
 acceding nation was voted to full consultative (voting) status, while
 no date indicates the country was an original 1959 treaty signatory.
 Claimant nations are - Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New
 Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant consultative nations are -
 Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador (1990), Finland (1989),
 Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, South Korea (1989),
 Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South Africa, Spain
 (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia. Acceding
 (nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parentheses, are -
 Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988), Cuba
 (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987),
 Guatemala (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea
 (1981), Romania (1971), Slovakia (1993), Switzerland (1990), and
 Ukraine (1992).
 Article 1: area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military
 activity, such as weapons testing, is prohibited, but military
 personnel and equipment may be used for scientific research or any
 other peaceful purpose
 Article 2: freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation shall
 continue
 Article 3: free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation
 with the UN and other international agencies
 Article 4: does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial
 claims and no new claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in
 force
 Article 5: prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive
 wastes
 Article 6: includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of
 60 degrees 00 minutes south
 Article 7: treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial
 observation, to any area and may inspect all stations, installations,
 and equipment; advance notice of all activities and of the
 introduction of military personnel must be given
 Article 8: allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by
 their own states
 Article 9: frequent consultative meetings take place among member
 nations
 Article 10: treaty states will discourage activities by any country in
 Antarctica that are contrary to the treaty
 Article 11: disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned
 or, ultimately, by the ICJ
 Articles 12, 13, 14: deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending
 the treaty among involved nations
 Other agreements: more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty
 consultative meetings and ratified by governments include - Agreed
 Measures for the Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964);
 Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention
 on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (1980); a
 mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 but was subsequently
 rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the
 Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits ratification; this agreement
 provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through five
 specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental
 impact assessments, waste management, and protected areas; it also
 prohibits all activities relating to mineral resources except
 scientific research; 14 parties have ratified Protocol as of April
 1995

 Legal system: US law, including certain criminal offenses by or
 against US nationals, such as murder, may apply to areas not under
 jurisdiction of other countries. Some US laws directly apply to
 Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C.
 section 2401 et seq., provides civil and criminal penalties for the
 following activities, unless authorized by regulation of statute: The
 taking of native mammals or birds; the introduction of nonindigenous
 plants and animals; entry into specially protected or scientific
 areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and the importation
 into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of the
 Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines
 and 1 year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce,
 Transportation, and Interior share enforcement responsibilities.
 Public Law 95-541, the US Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires
 expeditions from the US to Antarctica to notify, in advance, the
 Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, Room 5801, Department of State,
 Washington, DC 20520, which reports such plans to other nations as
 required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more information contact Permit
 Office, Office of Polar Programs, National Science Foundation,

ARCTIC OCEAN

@Arctic Ocean:Geography

 Location: body of water mostly north of the Arctic Circle

 Map references: Arctic Region

 Area:
 total area: 14.056 million sq km
 comparative area: slightly more than 1.5 times the size of the US;
 smallest of the world's four oceans (after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic
 Ocean, and Indian Ocean)
 note: includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea,
 East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea,
 Laptev Sea, Northwest Passage, and other tributary water bodies

 Coastline: 45,389 km

 International disputes: some maritime disputes (see littoral states);
 Svalbard is the focus of a maritime boundary dispute between Norway
 and Russia

 Climate: polar climate characterized by persistent cold and relatively
 narrow annual temperature ranges; winters characterized by continuous
 darkness, cold and stable weather conditions, and clear skies; summers
 characterized by continuous daylight, damp and foggy weather, and weak
 cyclones with rain or snow

 Terrain: central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack
 that averages about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges
 may be three times that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort
 Gyral Stream, but nearly straight line movement from the New Siberian
 Islands (Russia) to Denmark Strait (between Greenland and Iceland);
 the ice pack is surrounded by open seas during the summer, but more
 than doubles in size during the winter and extends to the encircling
 land masses; the ocean floor is about 50% continental shelf (highest
 percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a central basin
 interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera, Nansen
 Cordillera, and Lomonsov Ridge); maximum depth is 4,665 meters in the
 Fram Basin

 Natural resources: sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits,
 polymetallic nodules, oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals
 and whales)

 Environment:
 current issues: endangered marine species include walruses and whales;
 fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from disruptions
 or damage
 natural hazards: ice islands occasionally break away from northern
 Ellesmere Island; icebergs calved from glaciers in western Greenland
 and extreme northeastern Canada; permafrost in islands; virtually
 icelocked from October to June; ships subject to superstructure icing
 from October to May
 international agreements: NA

 Note: major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to
 the Pacific Ocean via the Bering Strait); strategic location between
 North America and Russia; shortest marine link between the extremes of
 eastern and western Russia, floating research stations operated by the
 US and Russia; maximum snow cover in March or April about 20 to 50
 centimeters over the frozen ocean and lasts about 10 months

Economy

 Overview: Argentina, rich in natural resources, benefits also from a
 highly literate population, an export-oriented agricultural sector,
 and a diversified industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of
 mismanagement and statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was
 plagued with huge external debts and recurring bouts of
 hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in the depths of recession, President
 MENEM has implemented a comprehensive economic restructuring program
 that shows signs of putting Argentina on a path of stable, sustainable
 growth. Argentina's currency has traded at par with the US dollar
 since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest level in 20
 years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability by
 repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry. The
 economy registered an impressive 6% advance in 1994, fueled largely by
 inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption spending.
 The government's major short term objective is encouraging exports,
 e.g., by reducing domestic costs of production. At the start of 1995,
 the government had to deal with the spillover from international
 financial movements associated with the devaluation of the Mexican
 peso. In addition, unemployment had become a serious issue for the
 government. Despite average annual 7% growth in 1991-94, unemployment
 surprisingly has doubled - due mostly to layoffs in government bureaus
 and in privatized industrial firms and utilities and, to a lesser
 degree, to illegal immigration. Much remains to be done in the 1990s
 in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth, extending the
 recent economic gains, and bringing down the rate of unemployment.

Economy

 Overview: Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had
 developed a more modern industrial sector, supplying machine building
 equipment, textiles, and other manufactured goods to sister republics
 in exchange for raw materials and energy resources. Armenia is a large
 food importer and its mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The
 economic decline in recent years (1991-94) has been particularly
 severe due to the ongoing conflict over the ethnic Armenian-dominated
 region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan and Turkey have
 blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to Armenia for its support of
 the Karabakh Armenians. This has left Armenia with chronic energy
 shortages because of a lack of capacity and frequent disruptions of
 natural gas deliveries through unstable Georgia, as well as
 difficulties in obtaining other types of fuel. In addition, bread is
 strictly rationed and there are shortages of other goods. In 1994, the
 economy seemed to bottom out. The government has managed to increase
 its financial and budgetary discipline, bringing inflation down from
 around 40% per month in first half 1994 to single digits in second
 half 1994 and the first quarter of 1995. A full economic recovery
 cannot be expected until the conflict is settled and the blockade
 lifted.

Economy

 Overview: Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy, although
 offshore banking and oil refining and storage are also important. The
 rapid growth of the tourism sector over the last decade has resulted
 in a substantial expansion of other activities. Construction has
 boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985 level. Additionally,
 the reopening of the country's oil refinery in 1993, a major source of
 employment and foreign exchange earnings, has further spurred growth.
 Aruba's small labor force and less than 1% unemployment rate have led
 to a large number of unfilled job vacancies despite sharp rises in
 wage rates in recent years.

Economy

 Overview: Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy,
 with a per capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West
 European countries. Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major
 exporter of agricultural products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels.
 Primary products account for more than 60% of the value of total
 exports, so that, as in 1983-84, a downturn in world commodity prices
 can have a big impact on the economy. The government is pushing for
 increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
 international markets continues to be severe. Australia has suffered
 from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD
 countries in the early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly
 from the prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor
 being weak world demand for Australia's exports. Growth picked up so
 strongly in 1994 that the government felt the need for fiscal and
 monetary tightening by yearend. Australia's GDP grew 6.4% in 1994,
 largely due to increases in industrial output and business investment.
 A severe drought in 1994 is expected to reduce the value of
 Australia's net farm production by $825 million in the twelve months
 through June 1995, but rising world commodity prices are likely to
 boost rural exports by 7.7% to $14.5 billion in 1995/96, according to
 government statistics.

Economy

 Overview: Austria boasts a prosperous and stable market economy with a
 sizable but falling proportion of nationalized industry and with
 extensive welfare benefits. Thanks to its raw material endowment, a
 technically skilled labor force, and strong links to German industrial
 firms, Austria occupies specialized niches in European industry and
 services (tourism, banking) and produces almost enough food to feed
 itself with only 8% of the labor force in agriculture. After 11
 consecutive years of growth, the Austrian economy experienced a mild
 recession in 1993, but growth resumed in 1994. Unemployment is 4.3%
 and will likely stay at that level as companies adjust to the
 competition of EU membership beginning 1 January 1995. To prepare for
 EU membership, Austria's government has taken measures to open the
 economy by introducing a major tax reform, privatizing state-owned
 firms, and liberalizing cross-border capital movements. Problems for
 the 1990s include an aging population, the high level of industrial
 subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary
 capabilities - the deficit climbed to over 4% of GDP in 1994.

AZERBAIJAN

 Note--Azerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved
 seven-year-old conflict with Armenian separatists over its
 Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Karabakh Armenians have declared
 independence and seized almost 20% of the country's territory,
 creating almost 1 million Azeri displaced persons in the process. Both
 sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place
 since May 1994, and support the OSCE-mediated peace process, now
 entering its fourth year. Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi
 (Stepanakert) remain far apart on most substantive issues from the
 placement and composition of a peacekeeping force to the enclave's
 ultimate political status, and prospects for a negotiated settlement
 remain dim.

Economy

 Overview: Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either
 Armenia or Georgia, the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the
 Central Asian states in its majority nominally Muslim population, high
 structural unemployment, and low standard of living. The economy's
 most prominent products are oil, cotton, and gas. Production from the
 Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline for several years, but
 the November 1994 ratification of the $7.5 billion oil deal with a
 consortium of Western companies should generate the funds needed to
 spur future industrial development. Azerbaijan accounted for 1.5% to
 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union.
 Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet
 republics in making the transition from a command to a market economy,
 but its considerable energy resources brighten its long-term
 prospects. Baku has only recently begun making progress on economic
 reform, and old economic ties and structures have yet to be replaced.

Economy

 Overview: Tiny in area, Bahrain is well-to-do in economic resources
 and per capita income. Petroleum production and processing account for
 about 80% of export receipts, 60% of government revenues, and 30% of
 GDP. Economic conditions have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of
 oil since 1985, for example, during and following the Gulf crisis of
 1990-91. With its highly developed communication and transport
 facilities Bahrain is home to numerous multinational firms with
 business in the Gulf. A large share of exports consists of petroleum
 products made from imported crude. Prospects for 1995 are good, with
 private enterprise the main driving force, e.g., in banking and
 construction. Unemployment, especially among the young, and the
 depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major
 long-term economic problems.

Economy

 Overview: Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to
 improve economic and demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains one of
 the world's poorest, most densely populated, and least developed
 nations. Its economy is overwhelmingly agricultural, with the
 cultivation of rice the single most important activity in the economy.
 Major impediments to growth include frequent cyclones and floods, the
 inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a rapidly growing labor force
 that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays in exploiting energy
 resources (natural gas), and inadequate power supplies. Excellent rice
 crops and expansion of the export garment industry led to real growth
 of 4% in 1992 and again in 1993. Policy measures intended to reduce
 government regulation of private industry, to curb population growth,
 and to expand employment opportunities have had only partial success
 given the serious nature of Bangladesh's basic problems.

Economy

 Overview: A per capita income of $9,200 gives Barbados one of the
 highest standards of living of all the small island states of the
 eastern Caribbean. Historically, the economy was based on the
 cultivation of sugarcane and related activities. In recent years,
 however, the economy has diversified into manufacturing and tourism. A
 moderate recovery that began in late 1993 after 3 years of contraction
 is mainly due to increased tourism and expansion in the construction
 sector. Economic prospects for 1995 depend mostly on continued growth
 in the industrialized countries, especially in Europe, which would
 spur further expansion in tourism.

Economy

 Overview: Belarus ranks among the most developed of the former Soviet
 states, with a relatively modern - by Soviet standards - and diverse
 machine building sector and a robust agriculture sector. It also
 serves as a transport link for Russian oil exports to the Baltic
 states and Eastern and Western Europe. The breakup of the Soviet Union
 and its command economy has resulted in a sharp economic contraction
 as traditional trade ties have collapsed. The Belarusian government
 has lagged behind the governments of most other former Soviet states
 in economic reform, with privatization almost nonexistent. The system
 of state orders and distribution persists. In mid-1994, the Belarusian
 government embarked on an austerity program with IMF support to slash
 state credits and consumer subsidies in order to bring down the budget
 deficit and reduce inflation. However, despite its promising start,
 the regime's drive to reinvigorate the economy has fallen short, and
 the IMF has criticized its failure to implement the reforms that the
 Fund had negotiated. As a result, the IMF has suspended talks on
 introducing a stand-by arrangement. Economic relations with Russia,
 which will have an important bearing on the future course of the
 economy, will be strengthened if Minsk adopts the necessary
 legislation to implement a customs union agreed to in January 1995.

Economy

 Overview: This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its
 central geographic location, highly developed transport network, and
 diversified industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated
 mainly in the populous Flemish area in the north, although the
 government is encouraging reinvestment in the southern region of
 Walloon. With few natural resources Belgium must import substantial
 quantities of raw materials and export a large volume of manufactures,
 making its economy unusually dependent on the state of world markets.
 Three-fourths of its trade is with other EU countries. The economy
 grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90, slowed to 1% in
 1991-92, dropped by 1.5% in 1993, and recovered with 2.3% growth in
 1994. Belgium's public debt has risen to 140% of GDP, and the
 government is trying to control its expenditures to bring the figure
 more into line with other industrialized countries.

Economy

 Overview: The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on
 subsistence agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth
 in real output has averaged a sound 4% in 1991-94 but this rate barely
 exceeds the rapid population growth of 3.3%. Inflation jumped to 35%
 in 1994 (compared to 3% in 1993) following the 50% currency
 devaluation in January. Commercial and transport activities, which
 make up almost 36% of GDP, are extremely vulnerable to developments in
 Nigeria as evidenced by decreased reexport trade in 1994 due to a
 severe contraction in Nigerian demand. The industrial sector accounts
 for less than 10% of GDP and mainly produces foods, beverages, cement,
 and textiles. Support by the Paris Club and official bilateral
 creditors has eased the external debt situation in recent years. The
 government, still burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a
 bloated civil service, is gradually implementing a World Bank
 supported structural adjustment program.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $6.7 billion (1994

Economy

 Overview: The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on
 agriculture and forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of
 the population and account for about half of GDP. Agriculture consists
 largely of subsistence farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains
 dominate the terrain and make the building of roads and other
 infrastructure difficult and expensive. The economy is closely aligned
 with India's through strong trade and monetary links. The industrial
 sector is small and technologically backward, with most production of
 the cottage industry type. Most development projects, such as road
 construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower
 potential and its attraction for tourists are key resources; however,
 the government limits the number of tourists to 4,000 per year to
 minimize foreign influence. Much of the impetus for growth has come
 from large public-sector companies. Nevertheless, in recent years,
 Bhutan has shifted toward decentralized development planning and
 greater private initiative. The government privatized several large
 public-sector firms, is revamping its trade regime and liberalizing
 administerial procedures over industrial licensing. The government's
 industrial contribution to GDP decreased from 13% in 1988 to about 11%
 in 1993.

Economy

 Overview: With its long history of semifeudal social controls,
 dependence on volatile prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of
 hyperinflation, Bolivia has remained one of the poorest and least
 developed Latin American countries. However, Bolivia has experienced
 generally improving economic conditions since the PAZ Estenssoro
 administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented policies which
 reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. PAZ
 Estenssoro was followed as President by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who
 continued the free-market policies of his predecessor, despite
 opposition from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor
 movement. By maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce
 inflation to 9.3% in 1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of
 3.25% during his tenure. Inaugurated in August 1993, President SANCHEZ
 DE LOZADA has vowed to advance the market-oriented economic reforms he
 helped launch as PAZ Estenssoro's planning minister. His successes so
 far have included an inflation rate that continues to decrease - the
 1994 rate of 8.5% was the lowest in ten years - the signing of a free
 trade agreement with Mexico, and progress on his unique privatization
 plan. The main privatization bill was passed by the Bolivian
 legislature in late March 1994. Related laws - one that establishes
 SIRESE, the regulatory agency that will oversee the privatizations,
 and another that outlines the rules for privatization in the
 electricity sector - were approved later in the year.

BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

 Note--Bosnia and Herzegovina is set to enter its third year of
 interethnic civil strife which began in the spring of 1992 after the
 Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina held a referendum on
 independence. Bosnia's Serbs - supported by neighboring Serbia -
 responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning the republic
 along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to 'greater Serbia'. In
 March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced the number of warring
 factions from three to two by signing an agreement in Washington, DC,
 creating the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A group of rebel
 Muslims, however, continues to battle government forces in the
 northwest enclave of Bihac. A Contact Group of countries, the US, UK,
 France, Germany, and Russia, continues to seek a resolution between
 the Federation and the Bosnian Serbs. In July of 1994 the Contact
 Group presented a plan to the warring parties that roughly equally
 divides the country between the two, while maintaining Bosnia in its
 current internationally recognized borders. The Federation agreed to
 the plan almost immediately, while the Bosnian Serbs rejected it.

Economy

 Overview: Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav
 Republic of Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav
 federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in private hands,
 farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic traditionally
 has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly
 overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central
 planning and management. TITO had pushed the development of military
 industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large
 share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of February 1995, Bosnia and
 Herzegovina was being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic
 warfare that has caused production to plummet, unemployment and
 inflation to soar, and human misery to multiply. No economic
 statistics for 1992-94 are available, although output clearly has
 fallen substantially below the levels of earlier years and almost
 certainly is well below $1,000 per head. The country receives
 substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the international
 community.

 Agriculture: accounted for 9.0% of GDP in 1989; regularly produces
 less than 50% of food needs; the foothills of northern Bosnia support
 orchards, vineyards, livestock, and some wheat and corn; long winters

Economy

 Overview: The economy has historically been based on cattle raising
 and crops. Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80%
 of the population but supplies only about 50% of food needs and
 accounts for only 5% of GDP. Subsistence farming and cattle raising
 predominate. The driving force behind the rapid economic growth of the
 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry. This sector, mostly on
 the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating 25% of GDP in 1980
 to 39% in 1994. No other sector has experienced such growth,
 especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
 poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Hampered
 by a still sluggish diamond market in 1994, GDP grew by only 1%.

Economy

 Overview: The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing
 sectors, entered the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway
 inflation, an unserviceable foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack
 of policy direction. In addition, the economy remained highly
 regulated, inward-looking, and protected by substantial trade and
 investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and mining
 facilities is divided among private interests - including several
 multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings
 are private, with the government channeling financing to this sector.
 Conflicts between large landholders and landless peasants have
 produced intermittent violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed
 office in March 1990, launched an ambitious reform program that sought
 to modernize and reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices,
 deregulating the economy, and opening it to increased foreign
 competition. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed the presidency following
 President COLLOR's resignation in December 1992, was out of step with
 COLLOR's reform agenda; initiatives to redress fiscal problems,
 privatize state enterprises, and liberalize trade and investment
 policies lost momentum. Galloping inflation - by June 1994 the monthly
 rate had risen to nearly 50% - had undermined economic stability. In
 response, the then finance minister, Fernando Henrique CARDOSO,
 launched the third phase of his stabilization plan, known as Plano
 Real, that called for a new currency, the real, which was introduced
 on 1 July 1994. Inflation subsequently dropped to under 3% per month
 through the end of 1994. The newly elected President CARDOSO has
 called for the implementation of sweeping market-oriented reform,
 including public sector and fiscal reform, privatization,
 deregulation, and elimination of barriers to increased foreign
 investment. Brazil's natural resources remain a major, long-term
 economic strength.

Economy

 Overview: The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean
 area, is highly dependent on the tourist industry, which generates
 about 21% of the national income. In 1985 the government offered
 offshore registration to companies wishing to incorporate in the
 islands, and, in consequence, incorporation fees generated about $2
 million in 1987. The economy slowed in 1991 because of the poor
 performances of the tourist sector and tight commercial bank credit.
 Livestock raising is the most significant agricultural activity. The
 islands' crops, limited by poor soils, are unable to meet food
 requirements.

Economy

 Overview: The Bulgarian economy continued its painful adjustment in
 1994 from the misdirected development undertaken during four decades
 of Communist rule. Many aspects of a market economy have been put in
 place and have begun to function, but much of the economy, especially
 the industrial sector, has yet to re-establish market links lost with
 the collapse of the other centrally planned Soviet Bloc economies. The
 prices of many imported industrial inputs, especially energy products,
 have risen markedly, and falling real wages have not sufficed to
 restore competitiveness. The government plans more extensive
 privatization in 1995 to improve the management of enterprises and to
 encourage foreign investment. Bulgaria resumed payments on its $10
 billion in commercial debt in 1993 following the negotiation of a 50%
 write-off.

Economy

 Overview: One of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina has a
 high population density and a high population growth rate, few natural
 resources, and a fragile soil. Economic development is hindered by a
 poor communications network within a landlocked country. Agriculture
 provides about 40% of GDP and is mainly of a subsistence nature.
 Industry, dominated by unprofitable government-controlled
 corporations, accounts for about 15% of GDP. Following the 50%
 currency devaluation in January 1994, the government updated its
 development program in conjunction with international agencies. Even
 with the best of plans, however, the government faces formidable
 problems on all sides.

Economy

 Overview: Burma has a mixed economy with about 75% private activity,
 mainly in agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with about
 25% state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy industry, and
 foreign trade. Government policy in the last six years, 1989-94, has
 aimed at revitalizing the economy after four decades of tight central
 planning. Thus, private activity has markedly increased; foreign
 investment has been encouraged, so far with moderate success; and
 efforts continue to increase the efficiency of state enterprises.
 Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly understated
 because of the volume of black market trade. A major ongoing problem
 is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal stability. Although
 Burma remains a poor Asian country, its rich resources furnish the
 potential for substantial long-term increases in income, exports, and
 living standards.

Economy

 Overview: A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of
 economic development, Burundi since October 1993 has suffered from
 massive ethnic-based violence that has displaced an estimated million
 people, disrupted production, and set back needed reform programs.
 Burundi is predominately agricultural with roughly 90% of the
 population dependent on subsistence agriculture. Its economic health
 depends on the coffee crop, which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange
 earnings. The ability to pay for imports therefore continues to rest
 largely on the vagaries of the climate and the international coffee
 market. As part of its economic reform agenda, launched in February
 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi is trying to diversify
 its agricultural exports, attract foreign investment in industry, and
 modernize government budgetary practices. Although the government
 remains committed to reforms, it fears new austerity measures would
 add to ethnic tensions.

Economy

 Overview: The Cambodian economy - virtually destroyed by decades of
 war - is slowly recovering. Government leaders are moving toward
 restoring fiscal and monetary discipline and have established good
 working relations with international financial institutions. Growth,
 starting from a low base, has been strong in 1991-94. Despite such
 positive developments, the reconstruction effort faces many tough
 challenges because of the persistence of internal political divisions
 and the related lack of confidence of foreign investors. Rural
 Cambodia, where 90% of about 9.5 million Khmer live, remains mired in
 poverty. The almost total lack of basic infrastructure in the
 countryside will hinder development and will contribute to a growing
 imbalance in growth between urban and rural areas over the near term.
 Moreover, the government's lack of experience in administering
 economic and technical assistance programs and rampant corruption
 among officials will slow the growth of critical public sector
 investment. Inflation for 1994 as a whole was less than a quarter of
 the 1992 rate and was declining during the year.

Economy

 Overview: Because of its offshore oil resources and favorable
 agricultural conditions, Cameroon has one of the best-endowed, most
 diversified primary commodity economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still,
 it faces many of the serious problems facing other underdeveloped
 countries, such as political instability, a top-heavy civil service,
 and a generally unfavorable climate for business enterprise. The
 development of the oil sector led rapid economic growth between 1970
 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986, precipitated by steep
 declines in the prices of major exports: coffee, cocoa, and petroleum.
 Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and inefficiencies in
 fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-93, with support from the IMF
 and World Bank, the government began to introduce reforms designed to
 spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, and
 recapitalize the nation's banks. Political instability, following
 suspect elections in 1992, brought IMF/WB structural adjustment to a
 halt. Although the 50% devaluation of the currency in January 1994
 improved the potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is
 the main barrier to economic improvement.

Economy

 Overview: As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today
 closely resembles the US in per capita output, market-oriented
 economic system, and pattern of production. Since World War II the
 impressive growth of the manufacturing, mining, and service sectors
 has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy into one
 primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada registered one of
 the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations, averaging
 about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force, and
 modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects,
 although the country still faces high unemployment and a growing debt.
 Moreover, the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and
 French-speaking areas has observers discussing a possible split in the
 confederation; foreign investors have become edgy.

Economy

 Overview: Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural
 resource base, serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of
 long-term drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service
 oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for
 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
 areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 20%; the fishing sector
 accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing
 potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape Verde
 annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances from
 emigrants and foreign aid, which form important supplements to GDP.
 Economic reforms, launched by the new democratic government in 1991,
 are aimed at developing the private sector and attracting foreign
 investment to diversify the economy. Prospects for 1995 depend heavily
 on the maintenance of aid flows, remittances, and the momentum of the
 government's development program.

Economy

 Overview: Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the
 backbone of the CAR economy, with more than 70% of the population
 living in outlying areas. The agricultural sector generates about half
 of GDP. Timber has accounted for about 26% of export earnings and the
 diamond industry for 54%. Important constraints to economic
 development include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor
 transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of
 misdirected macroeconomic policies. A major plus is the large forest
 reserves, which the government is moving to protect from
 overexploitation. The 50% devaluation of the currencies of 14
 Francophone African nations on 12 January 1994 had mixed effects on
 CAR's economy. While diamond, timber, coffee, and cotton exports
 increased - leading GDP to increase by 5.5% - inflation rose to 40%,
 fueled by the rising prices of imports on which the economy depends.
 CAR's poor resource base and primitive infrastructure will keep it
 dependent on multilateral donors and France for the foreseeable
 future.

Economy

 Overview: Climate, geographic remoteness, poor resource endowment, and
 lack of infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped
 countries in the world. Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil,
 conflict with Libya, drought, and food shortages. Consequently the
 economy has shown little progress in recent years in overcoming a
 severe setback brought on by civil war in the late 1980s. More than
 80% of the work force is involved in subsistence farming and fishing.
 Cotton is the major cash crop, accounting for at least half of
 exports. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, especially food
 credits, given chronic shortages in several regions. Of all the
 Francophone countries in Africa, Chad has benefited the least from the
 50% devaluation of their currencies on 12 January 1994. Despite an
 increase in external financial aid and favorable price increases for
 cotton - the primary source of foreign exchange - the corrupt and
 enfeebled government bureaucracy continues to dampen economic
 enterprise by neglecting payments to domestic suppliers and public
 sector salaries. Oil production in the Lake Chad area remains a
 distant prospect and the subsistence-driven economy probably will
 continue to limp along in the near term.

Economy

 Overview: Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market economy,
 with the degree of government intervention varying according to the
 philosophy of the different regimes. Under the center-left government
 of President AYLWIN, which took power in March 1990, spending on
 social welfare rose steadily. At the same time business investment,
 exports, and consumer spending also grew substantially. The new
 president, FREI, who took office in March 1994, has emphasized social
 spending even more. Growth in 1991-94 has averaged 6.5% annually, with
 an estimated one million Chileans having moved out of poverty in the
 last four years. Copper remains vital to the health of the economy;
 Chile is the world's largest producer and exporter of copper. Success
 in meeting the government's goal of sustained annual growth of 5%
 depends on world copper prices, the level of confidence of foreign
 investors and creditors, and the government's own ability to maintain
 a conservative fiscal stance.

Economy

 Overview: Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been
 trying to move the economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally
 planned economy to a more productive and flexible economy with market
 elements, but still within the framework of monolithic Communist
 control. To this end the authorities switched to a system of household
 responsibility in agriculture in place of the old collectivization,
 increased the authority of local officials and plant managers in
 industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale enterprise in
 services and light manufacturing, and opened the economy to increased
 foreign trade and investment. The result has been a strong surge in
 production, particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Industry
 also has posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong
 Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and modern
 production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and
 export goods. Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On
 the darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid
 system the worst results of socialism (bureaucracy, lassitude,
 corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains and stepped-up
 inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked, retightening
 central controls at intervals. In 1992-94 annual growth of GDP
 accelerated, particularly in the coastal areas - to more than 10%
 annually according to official claims. In late 1993 China's leadership
 approved additional long-term reforms aimed at giving more play to
 market-oriented institutions and at strengthening the center's control
 over the financial system. In 1994 strong growth continued in the
 widening market-oriented areas of the economy. At the same time, the
 government struggled to (a) collect revenues due from provinces,
 businesses, and individuals; (b) keep inflation within bounds; (c)
 reduce extortion and other economic crimes; and (d) keep afloat the
 large state-owned enterprises, most of which had not participated in
 the vigorous expansion of the economy. From 60 to 100 million surplus
 rural workers are adrift between the villages and the cities, many
 barely subsisting through part-time low-pay jobs. Popular resistance,
 changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres have
 weakened China's population control program, which is essential to the
 nation's long-term economic viability. One of the most dangerous
 long-term threats to continued rapid economic growth is the
 deterioration in the environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion,
 and the steady fall of the water table especially in the north.

Economy

 Overview: Colombia's economy has grown steadily since 1991, when the
 government implemented sweeping economic reform measures. President
 SAMPER, who took office in August 1994, has pledged to maintain those
 reforms while expanding government assistance for poor Colombians, who
 continue to make up about 40% of the population. In an effort to bring
 down inflation, SAMPER has arranged a "social pact" with business and
 labor to curtail price hikes and trim inflation to 18%. The rapid
 development of oil, coal, and other nontraditional industries, along
 with copious inflows of capital and strengthening of prices for
 coffee, have helped keep growth at 5%-6%. Development of the massive
 Cusiana oilfield provides the means to sustain this level over the
 next several years. Exporters say, however, that their sales have been
 hampered by the appreciation of the Colombian peso, and farmers have
 sought government help in adjusting to greater foreign competition.
 Moreover, increased foreign investment and even greater domestic
 growth have been hindered by an inadequate energy and transportation
 infrastructure and by violence stemming from drug trafficking and
 persistent rural insurgency.

Economy

 Overview: One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of
 several islands that have poor transportation links, a young and
 rapidly increasing population, and few natural resources. The low
 educational level of the labor force contributes to a subsistence
 level of economic activity, high unemployment, and a heavy dependence
 on foreign grants and technical assistance. Agriculture, including
 fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the leading sector of the economy.
 It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the labor force, and
 provides most of the exports. The country is not self-sufficient in
 food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for 90% of imports.
 The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical
 training, to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to
 improve health services, to diversify exports, and to reduce the high
 population growth rate. Continued foreign support is essential if the
 goal of 4% annual GDP growth is to be reached in the late 1990s.

Economy

 Overview: Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and
 handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on oil, support
 services, and a government characterized by budget problems and
 overstaffing. A reform program, supported by the IMF and World Bank,
 ran into difficulties in 1990-91 because of problems in changing to a
 democratic political regime and a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has
 supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the economy, providing about
 two-thirds of government revenues and exports. In the early 1980s
 rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to finance large-scale
 development projects with growth averaging 5% annually, one of the
 highest rates in Africa. Subsequently, growth has slowed to an average
 of roughly 1.5% annually, only two-thirds of the population growth
 rate. Political turmoil and misguided government investment have
 derailed economic reform programs sponsored by the IMF and World Bank.
 Even with these difficulties Congo enjoys one of the highest incomes
 per capita in sub-Saharan Africa

Economy

 Overview: Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export
 earners are fruit, copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are
 limited to a fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories.
 Economic development is hindered by the isolation of the islands from
 foreign markets and a lack of natural resources and good
 transportation links. A large trade deficit is annually made up for by
 remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid, largely from New
 Zealand. Current economic development plans call for exploiting the
 tourism potential and expanding the fishing industry.

Economy

 Overview: Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and
 exporters of coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently,
 the economy is highly sensitive to fluctuations in international
 prices for coffee and cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite
 attempts by the government to diversify, the economy is still largely
 dependent on agriculture and related industries. After several years
 of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy began a comeback in 1994,
 due to improved prices for cocoa and coffee, growth in non-traditional
 primary exports such as pineapples and rubber, trade and banking
 liberalization, offshore oil and gas discoveries, and generous
 external financing and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders and
 France. The 50% devaluation in January 1994 caused a one time jump in
 the inflation rate. Government adherence to a renewed structural
 adjustment program has led to a budget surplus for the first time in
 several years, a smaller personnel budget, and an increase in public
 investment. While real growth in 1994 was only 1.5%, the IMF and World
 Bank expect it will surpass 6% in 1995.

Economy

 Overview: Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic of
 Croatia, after Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized
 area, with a per capita output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav
 average. At present, Croatian Serb Separatists control approximately
 one-third of the Croatian territory, and one of the overriding
 determinants of Croatia's long-term political and economic prospects
 will be the resolution of this territorial dispute. Croatia faces
 serious economic problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime
 Communist mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; damage
 during the fighting to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and
 houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and
 the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former
 Yugoslav republics, as well as within its own territory. At the
 minimum, extensive Western aid and investment, especially in the
 tourist and oil industries, would seem necessary to revive the
 moribund economy. However, peace and political stability must come
 first; only then will recent government moves toward a
 "market-friendly" economy restore old levels of output. As of February
 1995, fighting continues among Croats, Serbs, and Muslims, and
 national boundaries and final political arrangements are still in
 doubt.

Economy

 Overview: Cuba's heavily statist economy remains severely depressed as
 the result of its own inefficiencies and the loss of massive amounts
 of economic aid from the former Soviet Bloc. Total output in 1994 was
 only about half the output of 1989. The fall in output and in imports
 is reflected in the deterioration of food supplies, shortages of
 electricity, inability to get spare parts, and the replacement of
 motor-driven vehicles by bicycles and draft animals. Higher world
 market prices for sugar and nickel in 1994, however, resulted in a
 slight increase in export earnings for the first time in six years,
 despite lower production of both commodities. The growth of tourism
 slowed in late 1994 as a result of negative publicity surrounding the
 exodus of Cubans from the island and other international factors. The
 government continued its aggressive search for foreign investment and
 announced preliminary agreements to form large joint ventures with
 Mexican investors in telecommunications and oil refining. In mid-1994,
 the National Assembly began introducing several new taxes and price
 increases to stem growing excess liquidity and restore some of the
 peso's value as a monetary instrument. In October the government
 attempted to stimulate food production by permitting the sale of any
 surplus production (over state quotas) at unrestricted prices at
 designated markets. Similar but much smaller markets were also
 introduced for the sale of manufactured goods in December. The various
 government measures have influenced a remarkable appreciation of the
 black market value of the peso, from more than 100 pesos to the dollar
 in September 1994 to 40 pesos to the dollar in early 1995. Policy
 discussions continue in the bureaucracy over the proper pace and scope
 of economic reform.

Economy

 Overview: The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and
 prosperous. Industry contributes 14% to GDP and employs 29% of the
 labor force, while the service sector contributes 53% to GDP and
 employs 57% of the labor force. An average 6.8% rise in real GDP
 between 1986 and 1990 was temporarily checked in 1991, because of the
 adverse effects of the Gulf war on tourism. After surging 8.5% in
 1992, growth slowed to 2.0% in 1993 - its lowest level in two decades
 - because of the decline in tourist arrivals associated with the
 recession in Western Europe, Cyprus' main trading partner, and the
 loss in export competitiveness due to a sharp rise in unit labor
 costs. Real GDP is likely to have picked up in 1994, and inflation is
 estimated to have risen to between 5% and 6%. The Turkish Cypriot
 economy has less than one-third the per capita GDP of the south.
 Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it has had much difficulty
 arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have hesitated to
 invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent on agriculture,
 which employs one-quarter of the work force. Moreover, because the
 Turkish lira is legal tender, the Turkish Cypriot economy has suffered
 the same high inflation as mainland Turkey. The small, vulnerable
 economy is estimated to have experienced a sharp drop in growth during
 1994 because of the severe economic crisis affecting the mainland. To
 compensate for the economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and
 indirect aid to nearly every sector; financial support has risen in
 value to about one-third of Turkish Cypriot GDP.

Economy

 Overview: The government of the Czech Republic, using successful
 stabilization policies to bolster its claims to full membership in the
 western economic community, has reduced inflation to 10%, kept
 unemployment at 3%, balanced the budget, run trade surpluses, and
 reoriented exports to the EU since the breakup of the Czechoslovak
 federation on 1 January 1993. GDP grew 2% in 1994 after stagnating in
 1993 and contracting nearly 20% since 1990. Prague's mass
 privatization program, including its innovative distribution of
 ownership shares to Czech citizens via 'coupon vouchers,' has made the
 most rapid progress in Eastern Europe. When coupon shares are
 distributed in early 1995, 75%-80% of the economy will be in private
 hands or partially privatized, according to the Czech government.
 Privatized companies still face major problems in restructuring; the
 number of annual bankruptcies quadrupled in 1994. In September 1994,
 Prague repaid $471 million in IMF loans five years ahead of schedule,
 making the Czech Republic the first East European country to pay off
 all IMF debts. Despite these outlays, hard-currency reserves in the
 banking system totaled more than $8.5 billion in October. Standard &
 Poor's boosted the Republic's credit rating to BBB+ in mid-1994 - up
 from a BBB rating that was already two steps higher than Hungary's and
 one step above Greece's rating. Prague forecasts a balanced budget, at
 least 3% GDP growth, 5% unemployment, and single-digit inflation for
 1995. Inflationary pressures - primarily as a result of foreign bank
 lending to Czech enterprises but perhaps also due to eased currency
 convertibility controls - are likely to be the most troublesome issues
 in 1995. Continuing economic recovery in Western Europe should boost
 Czech exports and production but a substantial increase in prices
 could erode the Republic's comparative advantage in low wages and
 exchange rates. Prague already took steps in 1994 to increase control
 over banking policies to neutralize the impact of foreign inflows on
 the money supply. Although Czech unemployment is currently the lowest
 in Central Europe, it will probably increase 1-2 percentage points in
 1995 as large state firms go bankrupt or are restructured and service
 sector growth slows.

Economy

 Overview: This thoroughly modern economy features high-tech
 agriculture, up-to-date small-scale and corporate industry, extensive
 government welfare measures, comfortable living standards, and high
 dependence on foreign trade. Denmark is self-sufficient in food
 production. The new center-left coalition government will concentrate
 on reducing the persistent high unemployment rate and the budget
 deficit as well as following the previous government's policies of
 maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. In the face
 of recent international market pressure on the Danish krone, the
 coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency. The coalition
 hopes to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax
 revenues; boost industrial competitiveness through labor market and
 tax reforms and increased research and development funds; and improve
 welfare services for the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays.
 Prime Minister RASMUSSEN's reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to
 the criteria for European integration by 1999; although Copenhagen has
 won from the European Union (EU) the right to opt out of the European
 Monetary Union (EMU) if a national referendum rejects it. Denmark is,
 in fact, one of the few EU countries likely to fit into the EMU on
 time. Denmark is weathering the current worldwide slump better than
 many West European countries. After posting 4.5% real GDP growth in
 1994, Copenhagen is predicting a continued strong showing in 1995,
 with real GDP up by 3.2%. The government expects an upswing in
 business investment in 1995 to drive economic growth. Although
 unemployment is high, it remains stable compared to most European
 countries.

Economy

 Overview: The economy is based on service activities connected with
 the country's strategic location and status as a free trade zone in
 northeast Africa. Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital
 city, the remainder being mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall
 limits crop production to fruits and vegetables, and most food must be
 imported. Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the
 region and an international transshipment and refueling center. It has
 few natural resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore,
 heavily dependent on foreign assistance (an important supplement to
 GDP) to help support its balance of payments and to finance
 development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be
 a major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over
 the last six years because of recession, civil war, and a high
 population growth rate (including immigrants and refugees).

Economy

 Overview: The Dominican economy showed some signs of slippage in 1994,
 although its overall performance in recent years has been relatively
 strong. After posting an increase of nearly 8% in 1992, GDP growth
 fell to 3% in 1993 and 1994 as mining output decreased and erosion of
 real wages caused private consumption to decline. A pre-election boost
 in government spending in early 1994 led to the first government
 deficit in four years and bumped inflation up to 14% for the year.
 Continued dynamism in construction and the services sector, especially
 tourism, should keep the economy growing in 1995. Tourism,
 agriculture, and manufacturing for export remain key sectors of the
 economy. Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural
 products, oil refining, and chemicals.

Economy

 Overview: Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural
 areas. Growth has been uneven in recent years because of fluctuations
 in prices for Ecuador's primary exports - oil and bananas - as well as
 because of government policies designed to curb inflation. President
 Sixto DURAN-BALLEN launched a series of macroeconomic reforms when he
 came into office in August 1992 which included raising domestic fuel
 prices and utility rates, eliminating most subsidies, and bringing the
 government budget into balance. These measures helped to reduce
 inflation from 55% in 1992 to 25% in 1994. DURAN-BALLEN has a much
 more favorable attitude toward foreign investment than his predecessor
 and has supported several laws designed to encourage foreign
 investment. Ecuador has implemented free or complementary trade
 agreements with Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, as well
 as applied for World Trade Organization membership. Ecuador signed a
 standby agreement with the IMF and rescheduled its $7.6 billion
 commercial debt in 1994 thereby regaining access to multilateral
 lending. Growth in 1994 speeded up to 3.9%, based on increased exports
 of bananas and non-traditional products, while international reserves
 increased to a record $1.6 billion.

Economy

 Overview: Half of Egypt's GDP originates in the public sector, most
 industrial plants being owned by the government. Overregulation holds
 back technical modernization and foreign investment. Even so, the
 economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but in
 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden
 of debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
 balance-of-payments support. Egypt's first IMF standby arrangement
 concluded in mid-1987 was suspended in early 1988 because of the
 government's failure to adopt promised reforms. Egypt signed a
 follow-on program with the IMF and also negotiated a structural
 adjustment loan with the World Bank in 1991. In 1991-93 the government
 made solid progress on administrative reforms such as liberalizing
 exchange and interest rates but resisted implementing major structural
 reforms like streamlining the public sector. As a result, the economy
 has not gained momentum and unemployment has become a growing problem.
 Egypt probably will continue making uneven progress in implementing
 the successor programs with the IMF and World Bank it signed onto in
 late 1993. Tourism has plunged since 1992 because of sporadic attacks
 by Islamic extremists on tourist groups. President MUBARAK has cited
 population growth as the main cause of the country's economic
 troubles. The addition of about 1.2 million people a year to the
 already huge population of 62 million exerts enormous pressure on the
 5% of the land area available for agriculture along the Nile.

Economy

 Overview: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing account for about half of
 GDP and nearly all exports. Subsistence farming predominates. Although
 pre-independence Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for
 hard currency earnings, the deterioration of the rural economy under
 successive brutal regimes has diminished potential for agriculture-led
 growth. A number of aid programs sponsored by the World Bank and the
 international donor community have failed to revitalize export
 agriculture. Businesses for the most part are owned by government
 officials and their family members. Commerce accounts for about 8% of
 GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for about
 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore,
 manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place
 under concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been
 moderately successful. Increased production from recently discovered
 natural gas fields will provide a greater share of exports in 1995.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $280 million (1993
 est.)

 National product real growth rate: 7.3% (1993 est.)

Economy

 Overview: With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea
 faces the bitter economic problems of a small, desperately poor
 African country. Most of the population will continue to depend on
 subsistence farming. Domestic output is substantially augmented by
 worker remittances from abroad. Government revenues come from custom
 duties and income and sales taxes. Eritrea has inherited the entire
 coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term prospects for revenues from
 the development of offshore oil, offshore fishing, and tourism. For
 the time being, Ethiopia will be largely dependent on Eritrean ports
 for its foreign trade.

Economy

 Overview: Bolstered by a widespread national desire to reintegrate
 into Western Europe, the Estonian government has pursued an ambitious
 program of market reforms and stabilization measures, which is rapidly
 transforming the economy. Three years after independence - and two
 years after the introduction of the kroon - Estonians are beginning to
 reap tangible benefits; inflation, though still high, was brought down
 to about 2% per month in second half 1994; production declines have
 bottomed out with estimated growth of 4% in 1994; and living standards
 are rising. Economic restructuring has been dramatic. By 1994 the
 service sector accounted for over 55% of GDP, while the once-dominant
 heavy industrial sector continues to shrink. The private sector is
 growing rapidly; the share of the state enterprises in the economy has
 steadily declined and by late 1994 accounted for only about 40% of
 GDP. Estonia's foreign trade has shifted rapidly from East to West;
 the Western industrialized countries now account for two-thirds of
 foreign trade.

Economy

 Overview: With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993, Ethiopia
 continues to face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest
 and least developed countries in Africa. Its economy is based on
 agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and
 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of export earnings. The
 agricultural sector suffers from frequent periods of drought, poor
 cultivation practices, and deterioration of internal security
 conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
 from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but
 less than 10% of agriculture, is state run. The government is
 considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants, and is
 implementing reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the
 economy. A major medium-term problem is the improvement of roads,
 water supply, and other parts of an infrastructure badly neglected
 during years of civil strife.

Economy

 Overview: The economy was formerly based on agriculture, mainly sheep
 farming, which directly or indirectly employs most of the work force.
 Dairy farming supports domestic consumption; crops furnish winter
 fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the
 sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
 surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So
 far, efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been
 unsuccessful. The economy has diversified since 1987 when the
 government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
 operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license
 fees total more than $40 million per year and support the island's
 health, education, and welfare system. To encourage tourism, the
 Falkland Islands Development Corporation has built three lodges for
 visitors attracted by the abundant wildlife and trout fishing. The
 islands are now self-financing except for defense. The British
 Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration zone around the
 islands in 1993 and early seismic surveys suggest substantial reserves
 capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day.

Economy

 Overview: The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living
 standards of the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the
 decline of the all-important fishing industry and one of the world's
 heaviest per capita external debts of about $25,000. When the nations
 of the world extended their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the
 early 1970s, the Faroese no longer could continue their traditional
 long-distance fishing and subsequently depleted their own nearby
 fishing areas. The government's tight controls on fish stocks and its
 austerity measures have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will
 force nationalization in the fishing industry, which has already been
 plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to withhold its
 annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly one-third of the islands'
 budget revenues - unless the Faroese make significant efforts to
 balance their budget. To this extent the Faroe government is expected
 to continue its tough policies, including introducing a 20%
 value-added tax (VAT) in 1993, and has agreed to an IMF
 economic-political stabilization plan. In addition to its annual
 subsidy, the Danish government has bailed out the second largest Faroe
 bank to the tune of $140 million since October 1992.

Economy

 Overview: Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large
 subsistence sector. Sugar exports and tourism are the major sources of
 foreign exchange. Industry contributes 13% to GDP, with sugar
 processing accounting for one-third of industrial activity. Roughly
 250,000 tourists visit each year. Political uncertainty and drought,
 however, contribute to substantial fluctuations in earnings from
 tourism and sugar and to the emigration of skilled workers. In 1992,
 growth was approximately 3%, based on growth in tourism and a
 lessening of labor-management disputes in the sugar and gold-mining
 sectors. In 1993, the government's budgeted growth rate of 3% was not
 achieved because of a decline in non-sugar agricultural output and
 damage from Cyclone Kina. Growth in 1994 is estimated to be 5%,
 largely attributed to increased tourism and expansion in domestic
 production, particularly in the manufacturing sector.

Economy

 Overview: Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market
 economy, with per capita output two-thirds of the US figure. Its key
 economic sector is manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and
 engineering industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods
 representing about 30% of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals,
 Finland depends on imports of raw materials, energy, and some
 components for manufactured goods. Because of the climate,
 agricultural development is limited to maintaining self-sufficiency in
 basic products. Forestry, an important export earner, provides a
 secondary occupation for the rural population. The economy, which
 experienced an average of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989,
 sank into deep recession in 1991 as GDP contracted by 6.5%. The
 recession - which continued in 1992 with GDP contracting by 4.1% - has
 been caused by economic overheating, depressed foreign markets, and
 the dismantling of the barter system between Finland and the former
 Soviet Union under which Soviet oil and gas had been exchanged for
 Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish Government has proposed
 efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and efficiency by an
 increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public expenditures,
 partial privatization of state enterprises, and changes in monetary
 policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the European
 Union's (EU) European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote stability.
 Ongoing speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in the
 government's policies forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by about
 12% in November 1991 and to indefinitely break the link in September
 1992. The devaluations have boosted the competitiveness of Finnish
 exports. The recession bottomed out in 1993, and Finland participated
 in the general European upturn of 1994. Unemployment probably will
 remain a serious problem during the next few years; the majority of
 Finnish firms face a weak domestic market and the troubled German and
 Swedish export markets. The Finns voted in an October 1994 referendum
 to enter the EU, and Finland officially joined the Union on 1 January
 1995. Increasing integration with Western Europe will dominate the
 economic picture over the next few years.

Economy

 Overview: One of the world's most highly developed economies, France
 has substantial agricultural resources and a diversified modern
 industrial sector. Large tracts of fertile land, the application of
 modern technology, and subsidies have combined to make it the leading
 agricultural producer in Western Europe. Largely self-sufficient in
 agricultural products, France is a major exporter of wheat and dairy
 products. The industrial sector generates about one-quarter of GDP,
 and the growing services sector has become crucial to the economy.
 Following stagnation and recession in 1991-93, French GDP in 1994
 expanded 2.4%. Growth in 1995 is expected to be in the 3.0% to 3.5%
 range. Persistently high unemployment will still pose a major problem
 for the government. Paris remains committed to maintaining the
 franc-deutsche mark parity, which has kept French interest rates high
 despite France's low inflation. Although the pace of economic and
 financial integration within the European Union has slowed down,
 integration presumably will remain a major force shaping the fortunes
 of the various economic sectors over the next few years.

Economy

 Overview: The economy is tied closely to that of France through
 subsidies and imports. Besides the French space center at Kourou,
 fishing and forestry are the most important economic activities, with
 exports of fish and fish products (mostly shrimp) accounting for more
 than 60% of total revenue in 1992. The large reserves of tropical
 hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an expanding sawmill industry
 that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation of crops - rice,
 cassava, bananas, and sugarcane - is limited to the coastal area,
 where the population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily
 dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious
 problem, particularly among younger workers.

Economy

 Overview: Notwithstanding its serious ongoing economic problems, Gabon
 enjoys a per capita income more than twice that of most nations of
 sub-Saharan Africa. Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil
 was discovered offshore in the early 1970s. The oil sector now
 accounts for 50% of GDP. Real growth was feeble in 1992 and Gabon
 continues to face the problem of fluctuating prices for its oil,
 timber, manganese, and uranium exports. Despite an abundance of
 natural wealth, and a manageable rate of population growth, the
 economy is hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal
 deficit widened to 2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrears on
 its bilateral debt, leading to a cancellation of rescheduling
 agreements with official and private creditors. Devaluation of its
 Francophone currency by 50% in January 1994 did not set off an
 expected inflationary spiral but the government must continue to keep
 a tight reign on spending and wage increases.

Economy

 Overview: The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural
 resources and has a limited agricultural base. About 75% of the
 population is engaged in crop production and livestock raising, which
 contribute 30% to GDP. Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing
 peanuts, fish, and hides - accounts for less than 10% of GDP. A
 sustained structural adjustment program, including a liberalized trade
 policy, had fostered a respectable 4% rate of growth in recent years.
 Reexport trade constitutes one-third of economic activity; however,
 border closures associated with Senegal's monetary crisis in late 1993
 led to a halving of reexport trade, reducing government revenues in
 turn. The 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made
 Senegalese goods more competitive and apparently prompted a relaxation
 of Senegalese controls, paving the way for a comeback in reexports.
 But overwhelming these developments were the devastating effects of
 the military's takeover in July 1994. By October, traffic at the Port
 of Banjul had fallen precipitously as importers nervously scaled back
 their activities with the commencement of the anticorruption drive by
 the new regime. Concerned with the growing potential for serious
 unrest after a countercoup attempt was bloodily put down by the
 regime, the United Kingdom and the EU in November issued a travelers
 advisory for The Gambia, which brought a halt to tourism almost
 immediately. The Gambia faces additional problems in 1995 if, as is
 likely, economic sanctions by Western governments remain in effect in
 response to indications that the military regime intends to stay in
 power far longer than expected by the donors.

Economy

 Overview: In 1991 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed
 across the border by Israeli industrial, construction, and
 agricultural enterprises, with worker remittances supplementing GDP by
 roughly 50%. Gaza depends upon Israel for nearly 90% of its external
 trade. Aggravating the impact of Israeli military administration,
 unrest in the territory since 1988 (intifadah) has raised unemployment
 and lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The Persian Gulf crisis
 and its aftershocks also have dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990.
 Worker remittances from the Gulf states have dropped, unemployment has
 increased, and exports have fallen. The withdrawal of Israel from the
 Gaza Strip in May 1994 brings a new set of adjustment problems.

GEORGIA

 Note--Georgia has been beset by ethnic and civil strife since
 independence. In late 1991, the country's first elected president,
 Zviad GAMSAKHURDIA was ousted in an armed coup. In October 1993,
 GAMSAKHURDIA, and his supporters sponsored a failed attempt to retake
 power from the current government led by former Soviet Foreign
 Minister Eduard SHEVARDNADZE. The Georgian government has also faced
 armed separatist conflicts in the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions.
 A cease-fire went into effect in South Ossetia in June 1992 and a
 joint Georgian-Ossetian-Russian peacekeeping force has been in place
 since that time. Georgian forces were driven out of the Abkhaz region
 in September 1993 after a yearlong war with Abkhaz separatists. Nearly
 200,000 Georgian refugees have since fled Abkhazia, adding
 substantially to the estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons
 already in Georgia. Russian peacekeepers are deployed along the border
 of Abkhazia and the rest of Georgia.

Economy

 Overview: Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around Black
 Sea tourism; cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of
 manganese and copper; and a small industrial sector producing wine,
 metals, machinery, chemicals, and textiles. The country imports the
 bulk of its energy needs, including natural gas and oil products. Its
 only sizable domestic energy resource is hydropower. Since 1990,
 widespread conflicts, e.g., in Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and
 Mingreliya, have severely aggravated the economic crisis resulting
 from the disintegration of the Soviet command economy in December
 1991. Throughout 1993 and 1994, much of industry was functioning at
 only 20% of capacity; heavy disruptions in agricultural cultivation
 were reported; and tourism was shut down. The country is precariously
 dependent on US and EU humanitarian grain shipments, as most other
 foods are priced beyond reach of the average citizen. Georgia is also
 suffering from an acute energy crisis, as it is having problems paying
 for even minimal imports. Georgia is pinning its hopes for recovery on
 reestablishing trade ties with Russia and on developing international
 transportation through the key Black Sea ports of P'ot'i and Bat'umi.
 The government began a tenuous program in 1994 aiming to stabilize
 prices and reduce large consumer subsidies.

 Agriculture: accounted for 97% of former USSR citrus fruits and 93% of
 former USSR tea; important producer of grapes; also cultivates
 vegetables and potatoes; dependent on imports for grain, dairy
 products, sugar; small livestock sector

 Illicit drugs: illicit cultivator of cannabis and opium poppy; mostly
 for domestic consumption; used as transshipment point for illicit
 drugs to Western Europe

Economy

 Overview: Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, progress
 towards economic integration between eastern and western Germany is
 clearly visible, yet the eastern region almost certainly will remain
 dependent on subsidies funded by western Germany until well into the
 next century. The staggering $390 billion in western German assistance
 that the eastern states have received since 1990 - 40 times the amount
 in real terms of US Marshall Fund aid sent to West Germany after World
 War II - is just beginning to have an impact on the eastern German
 standard of living, which plummeted after unification. Assistance to
 the east continues to run at roughly $100 billion annually. Although
 the growth rate in the east was much greater than in the west in
 1993-94, eastern GDP per capita nonetheless remains well below
 preunification levels; it will take 10-15 years for the eastern states
 to match western Germany's living standards. The economic recovery in
 the east is led by the construction industries which account for
 one-third of industrial output, with growth increasingly supported by
 the service sectors and light manufacturing industries. Eastern
 Germany's economy is changing from one anchored on manufacturing to a
 more service-oriented economy. Western Germany, with three times the
 per capita output of the eastern states, has an advanced market
 economy and is a world leader in exports. The strong recovery in 1994
 from recession began in the export sector and spread to the investment
 and consumption sectors in response to falling interest rates. Western
 Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population that enjoys
 excellent living standards, abundant leisure time, and comprehensive
 social welfare benefits. It is relatively poor in natural resources,
 coal being the most important mineral. Western Germany's world-class
 companies manufacture technologically advanced goods. The region's
 economy is mature: services and manufacturing account for the dominant
 share of economic activities, and raw materials and semimanufactured
 goods constitute a large portion of imports.

Economy

 Overview: Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana is relatively
 well off, having twice the per capita output of the poorer countries
 in West Africa. Heavily reliant on international assistance, Ghana has
 made steady progress in liberalizing its economy since 1983. Overall
 growth continued at a rate of approximately 5% in 1994, due largely to
 increased gold, timber, and cocoa production - major sources of
 foreign exchange. The economy, however, continues to revolve around
 subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 45% of GDP and employs 55%
 of the work force, mainly small landholders. Public sector wage
 increases, regional peacekeeping commitments, and the containment of
 internal unrest in the underdeveloped north have placed substantial
 demands on the government's budget and have led to inflationary
 deficit financing and a 27% depreciation of the cedi in 1994.

 est.)

 National product real growth rate: 5% (1994 est.)

Economy

 Overview: Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade and
 offshore banking. The British military presence has been severely
 reduced and now only contributes about 11% to the local economy. The

 fees, and duties on consumer goods also generate revenue. Because more
 than 70% of the economy is in the public sector, changes in government
 spending have a major impact on the level of employment.

Economy

 Overview: Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic
 entrepreneurial system overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist system that
 enlarged the public sector from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% in
 1989. Since then, the public sector has been reduced to about 60% of
 GDP. Tourism continues as a major source of foreign exchange, and
 agriculture is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy products, and
 animal feedstuffs. Over the last decade, real GDP growth has averaged
 1.6% a year, compared with the European Union average of 2.2%.
 Inflation continues to be well above the EU average, and the national
 debt has reached 140% of GDP, the highest in the EU. Prime Minister
 PAPANDREOU will probably make only limited progress correcting the
 economy's problems of high inflation, large budget deficit, and
 decaying infrastructure. His economic program suggests that although
 he will shun his expansionary policies of the 1980s, he will avoid
 tough measures needed to slow inflation or reduce the state's role in
 the economy. He has limited the previous government's privatization
 plans, for example, and has called for generous welfare spending and
 real wage increases. Athens continues to rely heavily on EU aid, which
 recently has amounted to about 6% of GDP. Greece almost certainly will
 not meet the EU's Maastricht Treaty convergence targets of public
 deficit held to 3% of GDP and national debt to 60% of GDP by 1999. Per
 capita GDP has fallen below Portugal's level, the lowest among EU
 members.

Economy

 Overview: Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult.
 Unemployment is increasing, and prospects for economic growth in the
 immediate future are dim. Following the closing of the Black Angel
 lead and zinc mine in 1989, Greenland became almost completely
 dependent on fishing and fish processing, the sector accounting for
 95% of exports. Prospects for fisheries are not bright, as the
 important shrimp catches will at best stabilize and cod catches have
 dropped. Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon activities is not around
 the corner, thus leaving only tourism with some potential for the near
 future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e., the central government
 and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant
 role in Greenland accounting for about two-thirds of total employment.
 About half the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish
 Government.

Economy

 Overview: The economy is essentially agricultural and centers on the
 traditional production of spices and tropical plants. Agriculture
 accounts for about 15% of GDP and 80% of exports and employs 24% of
 the labor force. Tourism is the leading foreign exchange earner,
 followed by agricultural exports. Manufacturing remains relatively
 undeveloped, but is expected to grow, given a more favorable private
 investment climate since 1983. The economy achieved an impressive
 average annual growth rate of 5.5% in 1986-91 but has stalled since
 1992. Unemployment remains high at about 25%.

Economy

 Overview: The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry,
 and services. It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and
 imports. Tourism is a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In
 addition, an increasingly large number of cruise ships visit the
 islands. The traditionally important sugarcane crop is slowly being
 replaced by other crops, such as bananas (which now supply about 50%
 of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. Other vegetables and root
 crops are cultivated for local consumption, although Guadeloupe is
 still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly from France.
 Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. Most
 manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
 high among the young.

Economy

 Overview: The economy depends mainly on US military spending and on
 revenues from tourism. Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has
 grown rapidly, creating a construction boom for new hotels and the
 expansion of older ones. Visitors numbered about 900,000 in 1992. The
 slowdown in Japanese economic growth has been reflected in less
 vigorous growth in the tourism sector. About 60% of the labor force
 works for the private sector and the rest for government. Most food
 and industrial goods are imported, with about 75% from the US. Guam
 faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector to
 offset the impact of military downsizing.

 institutions, and the legal framework are needed if the country is to
 move out of poverty. Except in the bauxite industry, foreign
 investment remains minimal.

Economy

 Overview: Guinea-Bissau ranks among the poorest countries in the
 world. Agriculture and fishing are the main economic activities.
 Cashew nuts, peanuts, and palm kernels are the primary exports.
 Exploitation of known mineral deposits is unlikely at present because
 of a weak infrastructure and the high cost of development. With IMF
 support the country is committed to an economic reform program
 emphasizing monetary stability and private sector growth. This process
 will continue at a slow pace because of a heavy foreign debt burden
 and internal constraints.

Economy

 Overview: Guyana, one of the poorest countries in the Western
 Hemisphere, has pushed ahead strongly in 1992-94, with an 8% average
 annual economic growth rate, led by gold mining, and rice, sugar, and
 forestry products for export. Favorable factors include recovery in
 the key agricultural and mining sectors, a more favorable atmosphere
 for business initiative, a more realistic exchange rate, a sharp drop
 in the inflation rate, and the continued support of international
 organizations. Serious underlying economic problems will continue.
 Electric power has been in short supply and constitutes a major
 barrier to future gains in national output. The government will have
 to persist in efforts to manage its large $2.2 billion external debt,
 control inflation, and to extend the privatization program.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $1.4 billion (1994
 est.)

Economy

 Overview: About 75% of the population live in abject poverty.
 Agriculture is mainly small-scale subsistence farming and employs
 two-thirds of the work force. The majority of the population does not
 have ready access to safe drinking water, adequate medical care, or
 sufficient food. The lack of employment opportunities remains one of
 the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil erosion
 and political instability. International trade sanctions in response
 to the September 1991 coup against President ARISTIDE further damaged
 the economy. The restoration of President ARISTIDE, the lifting of
 sanctions in late 1994, and foreign aid will alleviate some economic
 problems. Haiti will continue to depend heavily on foreign aid.

Economy

 Overview: Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western
 Hemisphere. Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy,
 accounts for 28% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces
 two-thirds of exports. Productivity remains low. Manufacturing, still
 in its early stages, employs 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15%
 of GDP, and generates 20% of exports. The service sectors, including
 public administration, account for 50% of GDP and employ 20% of the
 labor force. Many basic problems face the economy, including rapid
 population growth, high unemployment, inflation, a lack of basic
 services, a large and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of
 the export sector mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to
 sharp price fluctuations. A far-reaching reform program, initiated by
 former President CALLEJAS in 1990 and scaled back by President REINA,
 is beginning to take hold.

Economy

 Overview: Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few
 tariffs or nontariff barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food
 and raw materials must be imported. Manufacturing accounts for about
 17% of GDP. Goods and services exports account for about 50% of GDP.
 Real GDP growth averaged a remarkable 8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in
 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993,
 and 5.5% in 1994. Unemployment, which has been declining since the
 mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of labor continues to put
 upward pressure on prices and the cost of living. Prospects for
 1995-96 remain bright so long as major trading partners continue to be
 reasonably prosperous and so long as investors feel China will support
 free market practices after the takeover in 1997.

Economy

 Overview: Since 1989 Hungary has been a leader in the transition from
 a socialist command economy to a market economy - thanks in large part
 to its initial economic reforms during the Communist era. The private
 sector now accounts for about 55% of GDP. Nonetheless, the
 transformation is proving difficult, and many citizens say life was
 better under the old system. On the bright side, the four-year decline
 in output finally ended in 1994, as real GDP increased an estimated
 3%. This growth helped reduce unemployment to just over 10% by
 yearend, down from a peak of 13%. However, no progress was made
 against inflation, which remained stuck at about 20%, and the
 already-large current account deficit in the balance of payments
 actually got worse, reaching almost $4 billion. Underlying Hungary's
 other economic problems is the large budget deficit, which probably
 exceeded 7% of GDP in 1994, despite some late-year budget cutting by
 the new leftist government. In 1995 the government has pledged to
 accelerate privatization and lower the budget deficit to 5.5% of GDP.
 It believes this fiscal tightening will reduce the current account
 deficit to $2.5 billion but at the cost of holding economic growth to
 only 1%.

Economy

 Overview: Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically
 capitalistic, but with an extensive welfare system, relatively low
 unemployment, and comparatively even distribution of income. The
 economy is heavily dependent on the fishing industry, which provides
 nearly 75% of export earnings and employs 12% of the work force. In
 the absence of other natural resources - except energy - Iceland's
 economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The economy, in
 recession since 1988, began to recover in 1993, posting 0.4% growth,
 but was still hampered by cutbacks in fish quotas as well as falling
 world prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum,
 and ferrosilicon. Real GDP grew by perhaps 2.4% in 1994. The
 center-right government plans to continue its policies of reducing the
 budget and current account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing,
 containing inflation, revising agricultural and fishing policies,
 diversifying the economy, and privatizing state-owned industries. The
 government, however, remains divided on the issue of EU membership,
 primarily because of Icelanders' concern about losing control over
 their fishing resources.

Economy

 Overview: India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming,
 modern agriculture, handicrafts, a wide range of modern industries,
 and a multitude of support services. Faster economic growth in the
 1980s permitted a significant increase in real per capita private
 consumption. A large share of the population, perhaps as much as 40%,
 remains too poor to afford an adequate diet. Financial strains in 1990
 and 1991 prompted government austerity measures that slowed industrial
 growth but permitted India to meet its international payment
 obligations without rescheduling its debt. Production, trade, and
 investment reforms since 1991 have provided new opportunities for
 Indian businessmen and an estimated 100 million to 200 million middle
 class consumers. New Delhi has always paid its foreign debts on
 schedule and has stimulated exports, attracted foreign investment, and
 revived confidence in India's economic prospects. Foreign exchange
 reserves, precariously low three years ago, now total more than $19
 billion. Positive factors for the remainder of the 1990s are India's
 strong entrepreneurial class and the central government's recognition
 of the continuing need for market-oriented approaches to economic
 development, for example in upgrading the wholly inadequate
 communications facilities. Negative factors include the desperate
 poverty of hundreds of millions of Indians and the impact of the huge
 and expanding population on an already overloaded environment.

Economy

 Overview: The Indian Ocean provides major sea routes connecting the
 Middle East, Africa, and East Asia with Europe and the Americas. It
 carries a particularly heavy traffic of petroleum and petroleum
 products from the oilfields of the Persian Gulf and Indonesia. Its
 fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries
 for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia,
 Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for
 shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in
 the offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and western
 Australia. An estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production
 comes from the Indian Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and
 offshore placer deposits are actively exploited by bordering
 countries, particularly India, South Africa, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and
 Thailand.

 Industries: based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly
 fish, minerals, oil and gas, fishing, sand and gravel

Economy

 Overview: Indonesia is a mixed economy with some socialist
 institutions and central planning but with a recent emphasis on
 deregulation and private enterprise. Indonesia has extensive natural
 wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly increasing population, it
 remains a rather poor country. Real GDP growth in 1985-94 averaged
 about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash
 underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering
 the labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an
 important sector, accounting for 21% of GDP and over 50% of the labor
 force. The staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice
 importer, Indonesia is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops -
 rubber and palm oil - and textiles and plywood are being encouraged
 for both export and job generation. Industrial output now accounts for
 almost 40% of GDP and is based on a supply of diverse natural
 resources, including crude oil, natural gas, timber, metals, and coal.
 Foreign investment has also boosted manufacturing output and exports
 in recent years. Indeed, the economy's growth is highly dependent on
 the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan remains Indonesia's
 most important customer and supplier of aid. Rapid growth in the money
 supply in 1989-90 prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary
 policy in 1991, forcing the private sector to go to foreign banks for
 investment financing. Real interest rates remained above 10% and
 off-shore commercial debt grew. The growth in off-shore debt prompted
 Jakarta to limit foreign borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the
 continued problems in moving toward a more open financial system and
 the persistence of a fairly tight credit situation, GDP growth in
 1992-94 has matched the government target of 6%-7% annual growth.

Economy

 Overview: Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state
 ownership of oil and other large enterprises, village agriculture, and
 small-scale private trading and service ventures. Over the past
 several years, the government has introduced several measures to
 liberalize the economy and reduce government intervention, but most of
 these changes have moved slowly because of political opposition. Iran
 has faced increasingly severe financial difficulties since mid-1992
 due to an import surge that began in 1989 and general financial
 mismanagement. At yearend 1993 the Iranian Government estimated that
 it owed foreign creditors about $30 billion; an estimated $8 billion
 of this debt was in arrears. At yearend 1994, Iran rescheduled $12
 billion in debt. Earnings from oil exports - which provide 90% of
 Iran's export revenues - are providing less relief to Iran than usual
 because of reduced oil prices.

 1990 but are still trying to work out written agreements settling
 outstanding disputes from their eight-year war concerning border
 demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom of navigation and
 sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; in November 1994, Iraq
 formally accepted the UN-demarcated border with Kuwait which had been
 spelled out in Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991), 773 (1993),
 and 883 (1993); this formally ends earlier claims to Kuwait and to
 Bubiyan and Warbah islands; potential dispute over water development
 plans by Turkey for the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers

 summers; northern mountainous regions along Iranian and Turkish
 borders experience cold winters with occasionally heavy snows which
 melt in early spring, sometimes causing extensive flooding in central

 Environment:
 current issues: government water control projects have drained most of
 the inhabited marsh areas west of Al Qurnah by drying up or diverting
 the feeder streams and rivers; a once sizable population of Shi'a
 Muslims, who have inhabited these areas for thousands of years, has
 been displaced; furthermore, the destruction of the natural habitat
 poses serious threats to the area's wildlife populations; inadequate
 supplies of potable water; development of Tigris-Euphrates Rivers
 system contingent upon agreements with upstream riparian Turkey; air
 and water pollution; soil degradation (salinization) and erosion;
 desertification
 natural hazards: duststorms, sandstorms, floods

Economy

 Overview: The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central planning
 and management of industrial production and foreign trade while
 leaving some small-scale industry and services and most agriculture to
 private enterprise. The economy has been dominated by the oil sector,
 which has traditionally provided about 95% of foreign exchange
 earnings. In the 1980s, financial problems caused by massive
 expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil export
 facilities by Iran, led the government to implement austerity measures
 and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments.
 After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased
 with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged
 facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor
 shortages, salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land
 reform and collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although
 accorded high priority by the government, also was under financial
 constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent
 international economic embargoes, and military action by an
 international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically changed
 the economic picture. Industrial and transportation facilities, which
 suffered severe damage, have been partially restored. Oil exports
 remain at less than 5% of the previous level. Shortages of spare parts
 continue. Living standards deteriorated even further in 1993 and 1994;
 consumer prices have more than doubled in both 1993 and 1994. The
 UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and imports and has
 contributed to the sharp rise in prices. The Iraqi government has been
 unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so that the economic embargo can
 be removed. The government's policies of supporting large military and
 internal security forces and of allocating resources to key supporters
 of the regime have exacerbated shortages. In brief, per capita output
 in 1993-94 is far below the 1989-90 level, but no precise estimate is
 available.

Economy

 Overview: The economy is small and trade dependent. Agriculture, once
 the most important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts
 for 37% of GDP, about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor
 force. Although exports remain the primary engine for Ireland's robust
 growth, the economy is also benefiting from a rise in consumer
 spending and recovery in both construction and business investment.
 Ireland has substantially reduced its external debt since 1987, to 40%
 of GDP in 1994. Over the same period, inflation has fallen sharply and
 chronic trade deficits have been transformed into annual surpluses.
 Unemployment remains a serious problem, however, and job creation is
 the main focus of government policy. To ease unemployment, Dublin
 aggressively courts foreign investors and recently created a new
 industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms.
 Government assistance is constrained by Dublin's continuing deficit
 reduction measures.

Economy

 Overview: Israel has a market economy with substantial government
 participation. It depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw
 materials, and military equipment. Despite limited natural resources,
 Israel has intensively developed its agricultural and industrial
 sectors over the past 20 years. Industry employs about 22% of Israeli
 workers, construction 6.5%, agriculture, forestry, and fishing 3.5%,
 and services most of the rest. Israel is largely self-sufficient in
 food production except for grains. Diamonds, high-technology
 equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and vegetables) are
 leading exports. Israel usually posts current account deficits, which
 are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by foreign
 loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt is owed to the
 United States, which is its major source of economic and military aid.
 To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel has been targeting
 high-technology niches in international markets, such as medical
 scanning equipment. The influx of Jewish immigrants from the former
 USSR, which topped 450,000 during the period 1990-94, increased
 unemployment, intensified housing problems, and strained the
 government budget. At the same time, the immigrants bring to the
 economy valuable scientific and professional expertise.

Economy

 Overview: Since World War II the Italian economy has changed from one
 based on agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with
 approximately the same total and per capita output as France and the
 UK. The country is still divided into a developed industrial north,
 dominated by private companies, and an undeveloped agricultural south,
 dominated by large public enterprises. Services account for 48% of
 GDP, industry 35%, agriculture 4%, and public administration 13%. Most
 raw materials needed by industry and over 75% of energy requirements
 must be imported. After growing at an average annual rate of 3% in
 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and 1992, fell by 0.7% in
 1993, and recovered to 2% in 1994. In the second half of 1992, Rome
 became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to participate in
 EU plans for economic and monetary union later in the decade; thus it
 finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances. Subsequently, the
 government has adopted fairly stringent budgets, abandoned its highly
 inflationary wage indexation system, and started to scale back its
 extremely generous social welfare programs, including pension and
 health care benefits. Monetary officials were forced to withdraw the
 lira from the European monetary system in September 1992 when it came
 under extreme pressure in currency markets. For the 1990s, Italy faces
 the problems of pushing ahead with fiscal reform, refurbishing a
 tottering communications system, curbing pollution in major industrial
 centers, and adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the
 ongoing expansion and economic integration of the European Union.

Economy

 Overview: Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic,
 mastery of high technology, and a comparatively small defense
 allocation (roughly 1% of GDP) have helped Japan advance with
 extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second most powerful economy in
 the world. Industry, the most important sector of the economy, is
 heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels. Usually
 self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its
 requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of
 the world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the
 global catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10%
 average in the 1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic
 growth came to a halt in 1992-93 largely because of contractionary
 domestic policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the
 stock and real estate markets. Growth resumed at a 0.6% pace in 1994
 largely because of consumer demand. As for foreign trade, the stronger
 yen and slower global growth are containing export growth.
 Unemployment and inflation remain remarkably low in comparison with
 the other industrialized nations. Japan continues to run a huge trade
 surplus - $121 billion in 1994, roughly the same size as in 1993 -
 which supports extensive investment in foreign assets. Prime Minister
 MURAYAMA has yet to formalize his government's plans for
 administrative and economic reform, including reduction in the trade
 surplus. As leader of a coalition government, he has softened his own
 socialist positions. The crowding of the habitable land area and the
 aging of the population are two major long-run problems.

Economy

 Overview: The economy is based largely on financial services,
 agriculture, and tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and
 especially flowers are important export crops, shipped mostly to the
 UK. The Jersey breed of dairy cattle is known worldwide and represents
 an important export earner. Milk products go to the UK and other EU
 countries. In 1986 the finance sector overtook tourism as the main
 contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the island's output. In
 recent years the government has encouraged light industry to locate in
 Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry has developed
 alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw material
 and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
 Jersey's food needs.

Economy

 Overview: Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom
 of the late 1970s and early 1980s, when its annual real GNP growth
 averaged more than 10%. In the remainder of the 1980s, however,
 reductions in both Arab aid and worker remittances slowed real
 economic growth to an average of roughly 2% per year. Imports - mainly
 oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food - outstripped exports,
 with the difference covered by aid, remittances, and borrowing. In
 mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling
 negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF-supported program designed
 to gradually reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed
 structural reforms. The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990,
 however, aggravated Jordan's already serious economic problems,
 forcing the government to shelve the IMF program, stop most debt
 payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab
 states, worker remittances, and trade contracted; and refugees flooded
 the country, producing serious balance-of-payments problems, stunting
 GDP growth, and straining government resources. The economy rebounded
 in 1992, largely due to the influx of capital repatriated by workers
 returning from the Gulf, but the recovery was uneven throughout 1994.
 The government is implementing the reform program adopted in 1992 and
 continues to secure rescheduling and write-offs of its heavy foreign
 debt. Debt, poverty, and unemployment remain Jordan's biggest on-going
 problems.

Economy

 Overview: Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet states
 in territory, possesses enormous untapped fossil-fuel reserves as well
 as plentiful supplies of other minerals and metals. It also has
 considerable agricultural potential with its vast steppe lands
 accommodating both livestock and grain production. Kazakhstan's
 industrial sector rests on the extraction and processing of these
 natural resources and also on a relatively large machine building
 sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors, agricultural
 machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR and the
 collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry
 products have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since
 1991, with the steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. The
 government has pursued a moderate program of economic reform and
 privatization which is gradually lifting state controls over economic
 activity and shifting assets into the private sector. Nevertheless,
 government control over key sectors of the economy remains strong.
 Sustained economic hardships and continued pressures from industrial
 elites will make it difficult for the government to sustain its
 policies of monetary and fiscal discipline which had brought down
 inflation by the end of 1994. Continued lack of pipeline
 transportation for expanded oil exports has closed off a likely source
 of economic recovery.

Economy

 Overview: Kenya in recent years has had one of the highest natural
 rates of growth in population, but the statistics have been
 complicated by the large-scale movement of nomadic groups and of
 Somalis back and forth across the border. Population growth has been
 accompanied by deforestation, deterioration in the road system, the
 water supply, and other parts of the infrastructure. In industry and
 services, Nairobi's reluctance to embrace IMF-supported reforms had
 held back investment and growth in 1991-93. Nairobi's push on economic
 reform in 1994, however, helped support a 3.3% increase in output.

Economy

 Overview: A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls, Kiribati has
 few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate deposits were
 exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish now
 represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has
 fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP declined about 5% in 1987,
 as the fish catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986
 and copra production was hampered by repeated rains. Output rebounded
 strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 10%. The upturn in economic
 growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish
 catch. GDP then fell by 2.2% in 1989 and by 2.9% in 1990, but has
 risen by about 3% annually in 1991-93. Foreign financial aid, largely
 from the UK and Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP, amounting to
 25%-50% of GDP in recent years.

Economy

 Overview: More than 90% of this command economy is socialized;
 agricultural land is collectivized; and state-owned industry produces
 95% of manufactured goods. State control of economic affairs is
 unusually tight even for a Communist country because of the small size
 and homogeneity of the society and the strict rule of KIM Il-song in
 the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during the
 period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output declined by 3%-5% annually
 during 1989-92 because of systemic problems and disruptions in
 socialist-style economic relations with the former USSR and China. In
 1992, output dropped sharply, by perhaps 7%-9%, as the economy felt
 the cumulative effect of the reduction in outside support. The
 leadership insisted on maintaining its high level of military outlays
 from a shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in
 inventories and critical shortages in the energy sector have led to
 increasing interruptions in industrial production. Abundant mineral
 resources and hydropower have formed the basis of industrial
 development since World War II. Output of the extractive industries
 includes coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and
 precious metals. Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry,
 including military industry, with light industry lagging far behind.
 Despite the use of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation,
 and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become
 self-sufficient in food production. Indeed, a shortage of arable
 lands, several years of poor harvests, and a cumbersome distribution
 system have resulted in chronic food shortages. The collapse of
 Communism in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 1989-91 has
 disrupted important technological links. North Korea remains far
 behind South Korea in economic development and living standards. GDP
 is stagnant.

Economy

 Overview: The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth has
 been the planned development of an export-oriented economy in a
 vigorously entrepreneurial society. Real GDP increased more than 10%
 annually between 1986 and 1991. This growth ultimately led to an
 overheated situation characterized by a tight labor market, strong
 inflationary pressures, and a rapidly rising current account deficit.
 As a result, in 1992, economic policy focused on slowing the growth
 rate of inflation and reducing the deficit. Annual growth slowed to
 5%, still above the rate in most other countries of the world, and
 recovered to 6.3% in 1993. The economy expanded by 8.3% in 1994,
 driven by booming exports.

Economy

 Overview: Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with proved
 crude oil reserves of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world
 reserves. Kuwait has rebuilt its war-ravaged petroleum sector; its
 crude oil production reached at least 2.0 million barrels per day by
 the end of 1993. The government ran a sizable fiscal deficit in 1993.
 Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP and 90% of export and
 government revenues. Kuwait lacks water and has practically no arable
 land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With the exception
 of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75% of
 potable water must be distilled or imported. Because of its high per
 capita income, comparable with Western European incomes, Kuwait
 provides its citizens with extensive health, educational, and
 retirement benefits. Per capita military expenditures are among the
 highest in the world. The economy improved moderately in 1994, with
 the growth in industry and finance, and should see further gains in
 1995, especially if oil prices go up. The World Bank has urged Kuwait
 to push ahead with privatization, including in the oil industry, but
 the government will move slowly on this front.

Economy

 Overview: Kyrgyzstan is one of the smallest and poorest states of the
 former Soviet Union. Its economy is heavily agricultural, growing
 cotton and tobacco on irrigated land in the south and grain in the
 foothills of the north and raising sheep and goats on mountain
 pastures. Its small and obsolescent industrial sector, concentrated
 around Bishkek, has traditionally relied on Russia and other CIS
 countries for customers and industrial inputs, including most of its
 fuel. Since 1990, the economy has contracted by almost 50% as
 subsidies from Moscow vanished and trade links with other former
 Soviet republics eroded. At the same time, the Kyrgyz government stuck
 to tight monetary and fiscal policies in 1994 that succeeded in
 reducing inflation from 23% per month in 1993 to 5.4% per month in
 1994. Moreover, Kyrgyzstan has been the most successful of the Central
 Asian states in reducing state controls over the economy and
 privatizing state industries. Nevertheless, restructuring proved to be
 a slow and painful process in 1994 despite relatively large flows of
 foreign aid and continued progress on economic reform. The decline in
 output in 1995 may be much smaller, perhaps 5%, compared with an
 estimated 24% in 1994.

Economy

 Overview: The government of Laos - one of the few remaining official
 Communist states - has been decentralizing control and encouraging
 private enterprise since 1986. The results, starting from an extremely
 low base, have been striking - growth has averaged 7.5% annually since
 1988. Even so, Laos is a landlocked country with a primitive
 infrastructure. It has no railroads, a rudimentary road system, and
 limited external and internal telecommunications. Electricity is
 available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture accounts
 for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The predominant
 crop is rice. In non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient overall in
 food, but each year flood, pests, and localized drought cause
 shortages in various parts of the country. For the foreseeable future
 the economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and other
 international sources; aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has
 been cut sharply. As in many developing countries, deforestation and
 soil erosion will hamper efforts to maintain the high rate of GDP
 growth.

Economy

 Overview: Latvia is rapidly becoming a dynamic market economy, rivaled
 only by Estonia among the former Soviet states in the speed of its
 transformation. However, the transition has been painful; in 1994 the
 IMF reported a 2% growth in GDP, following steep declines in 1992-93.
 The government's tough monetary policies and reform program have kept
 inflation at less than 2% a month, supported a dynamic private sector
 now accounting for more than half of GDP, and spurred the growth of
 trade ties with the West. Much of agriculture is already privatized
 and the government plans to step up the pace of privatization of state
 enterprises. Latvia thus is in the midst of recovery, helped by the
 country's strategic location on the Baltic Sea, its well-educated
 population, and its diverse - albeit largely obsolete - industrial
 structure.

LEBANON

 Note--Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political
 institutions and regaining its national sovereignty since the end of
 the devastating 16-year civil war which began in 1975. Under the Ta'if
 accord - the blueprint for national reconciliation - the Lebanese have
 established a more equitable political system, particularly by giving
 Muslims a greater say in the political process. Since December 1990,
 the Lebanese have formed three cabinets and conducted the first
 legislative election in 20 years. Most of the militias have been
 weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) has seized vast
 quantities of weapons used by the militias during the war and extended
 central government authority over about one-half of the country.
 Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, retains most of its weapons.
 Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops
 in southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, The Army
 of South Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous
 to its border. The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared
 security zone and about 20 kilometers north to the strategic town of
 Jazzine. As of December 1993, Syria maintained about 30,000-35,000
 troops in Lebanon. These troops are based mainly in Beirut, North
 Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's deployment was legitimized by
 the Arab League early in Lebanon's civil war and in the Ta'if accord.
 Citing the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's requests, and
 failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the
 constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far
 refused to withdraw its troops from Beirut.

Economy

 Overview: The 1975-1991 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's economic
 infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended
 Lebanon's position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. A
 tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin restoring
 control in Beirut, collect taxes, and regain access to key port and
 government facilities. The battered economy has also been propped up
 by a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and
 medium-scale manufacturers. Family remittances, banking transactions,
 manufactured and farm exports, the narcotics trade, and international
 emergency aid are the main sources of foreign exchange. In the
 relatively settled year of 1991, industrial production, agricultural
 output, and exports showed substantial gains. The further rebuilding
 of the war-ravaged country was delayed in 1992 because of an upturn in
 political wrangling. In October 1992, Rafiq HARIRI was appointed Prime
 Minister. HARIRI, a wealthy entrepreneur, announced ambitious plans
 for Lebanon's reconstruction which involve a substantial influx of
 foreign aid and investment. Progress on restoring basic services is
 limited. Since Prime Minister HARIRI's appointment, the most
 significant improvement lies in the stabilization of the Lebanese
 pound, which had gained over 30% in value by yearend 1993. The years
 1993 and 1994 were marked by efforts of the new administration to
 encourage domestic and foreign investment and to obtain additional
 international assistance. The construction sector led the 8.5% advance
 in real GDP in 1994.

Economy

 Overview: Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important
 natural resources other than water. Its economy is based on
 agriculture, light manufacturing, and remittances from laborers
 employed in South Africa (these remittances supplement domestic income
 by as much as 45%). The great majority of households gain their
 livelihoods from subsistence farming and migrant labor; a large
 portion of the adult male work force is employed in South African
 mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to support the
 milling, canning, leather, and jute industries; other industries
 include textile, clothing, and construction. Although drought has
 decreased agricultural activity over the past few years, improvement
 of a major hydropower facility will permit the sale of water to South
 Africa and allow Lesotho's economy to continue its moderate growth.

Economy

 Overview: Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's
 economy, especially the infrastructure in and around Monrovia.
 Businessmen have fled the country, taking capital and expertise with
 them. Many will not return. Richly endowed with water, mineral
 resources, forests, and a climate favorable to agriculture, Liberia
 had been a producer and exporter of basic products, while local
 manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope.
 Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction
 and repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who have fled to
 neighboring countries. The political impasse between the interim
 government and rebel leader Charles TAYLOR has prevented restoration
 of normal economic life, including the re-establishment of a strong
 central government with effective economic development programs. The
 economy deteriorated further in 1994.

Economy

 Overview: The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon
 revenues from the oil sector, which contributes practically all export
 earnings and about one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was the
 highest in Africa at $5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and
 fluctuated sharply in response to changes in the world oil market.
 Import restrictions and inefficient resource allocations have led to
 periodic shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs. Windfall revenues
 from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990 improved the foreign
 payments position and resulted in a current account surplus through
 1992. The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, which account
 for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly
 agricultural products to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and
 aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs
 18% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely
 limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food
 requirements. The UN sanctions imposed in April 1992 have not yet had
 a major impact on the economy because Libya's oil revenues generate
 sufficient foreign exchange which sustains imports of food, consumer
 goods, and equipment for the oil industry and ongoing development
 projects.

Economy

 Overview: Despite its small size and limited natural resources,
 Liechtenstein has developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized,
 free-enterprise economy with a vital service sector and living
 standards on par with its large European neighbors. Low business taxes
 - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and easy incorporation rules have
 induced about 25,000 holding or so-called letter box companies to
 establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, providing 30% of state
 revenues. The country participates in a customs union with Switzerland
 and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. Liechtenstein plans
 to join the European Economic Area (an organization serving as a
 bridge between EFTA and EU) in 1995.

Economy

 Overview: Since independence in September 1991, Lithuania has made
 steady progress in developing a market economy. Almost 50% of state
 property has been privatized and trade is diversifying with a gradual
 shift away from the former Soviet Union to Western markets. In
 addition, the Lithuanian government has adhered to a disciplined
 budgetary and financial policy which has brought inflation down from a
 monthly average of around 14% in first half 1993 to an average of 3.1%
 in 1994. Nevertheless, the process has been painful with industrial
 output in 1993 less than half the 1991 level. The economy appeared to
 have bottomed out in 1994, and Vilnius's policies have laid the
 groundwork for vigorous recovery over the next few years. Recovery
 will build on Lithuanian's strategic location with its ice-free port
 at Klaipeda and its rail and highway hub in Vilnius connecting it with
 Eastern Europe, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, and on its agriculture
 potential, highly skilled labor force, and diversified industrial
 sector. Lacking important natural resources, it will remain dependent
 on imports of fuels and raw materials.

Economy

 Overview: The stable, prosperous economy features moderate growth, low
 inflation, and negligible unemployment. Agriculture is based on small
 but highly productive family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until
 recently dominated by steel, has become increasingly more diversified,
 particularly toward high-technology firms. During the past decade,
 growth in the financial sector has more than compensated for the
 decline in steel. Services, especially banking, account for a growing
 proportion of the economy. Luxembourg participates in an economic
 union with Belgium on trade and most financial matters, is also
 closely connected economically to the Netherlands, and as a member of
 the 15-member European Union enjoys the advantages of the open
 European market.

Economy

 Overview: The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, although the
 poorest republic in the former Yugoslav federation, can meet basic
 food and energy needs through its own agricultural and coal resources.
 Its economic decline will continue unless ties are reforged or
 enlarged with its neighbors Serbia and Montenegro, Albania, Greece,
 and Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside sources for all of its
 oil and gas and most of its modern machinery and parts. An important
 supplement of GDP is the remittances from thousands of Macedonians
 working in Germany and other West European nations. Continued
 political turmoil, both internally and in the region as a whole,
 prevents any swift readjustments of trade patterns and economic
 programs. The country's industrial output and GDP are expected to
 decline further in 1995. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's
 geographical isolation, technological backwardness, and potential
 political instability place it far down the list of countries of
 interest to Western investors. Resolution of the dispute with Greece
 and an internal commitment to economic reform would encourage foreign
 investment over the long run. In the immediate future, the worst
 scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its
 borders.

Economy

 Overview: Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world,
 suffering from chronic malnutrition, underfunded health and education
 facilities, a 3% annual population growth rate, and severe loss of
 forest cover, accompanied by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing
 and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting for over 30%
 of GDP and contributing more than 70% of total export earnings.
 Industry is largely confined to the processing of agricultural
 products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted for only 13%
 of GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year development plan
 that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990,
 increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports.
 Subsequently, growth in output has been held back because of
 protracted antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political
 reform. Since 1993, corruption and political instability have caused
 the economy and infrastructure to decay further. Since April 1994, the
 government commitment to economic reforms has been erratic. Enormous
 obstacles stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its considerable
 growth potential.

Economy

 Overview: Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least developed
 countries. The economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90%
 of the population living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40%
 of GDP and 90% of export revenues. After two years of weak
 performance, economic growth improved significantly in 1988-91 as a
 result of good weather and a broadly based economic adjustment effort
 by the government. Drought cut overall output sharply in 1992, but the
 lost ground was recovered in 1993. The economy depends on substantial
 inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and
 individual donor nations. The new government faces strong challenges,
 e.g., to spur exports, to improve educational and health facilities,
 and to deal with environmental problems of deforestation and erosion.

 soundly managed public sector, has posted a remarkable record of 9%

Economy

 Overview: Fishing is the largest industry, employing 25% of the work
 force and accounting for over 60% of exports. Over 90% of government
 tax revenue comes from import duties and tourism-related taxes. During
 the 1980s tourism became one of the most important and highest growth
 sectors of the economy. In 1993, tourism accounted for 17% of GDP and
 more than 60% of the Maldives' foreign exchange receipts. The
 Maldivian government initiated an economic reform program in 1989
 initially by lifting import quotas and opening some exports to the
 private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations to allow
 more foreign investment. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to
 play a minor role in the economy, constrained by the limited
 availability of cultivatable land and the shortage of domestic labor.
 Most staple foods must be imported. In 1993, industry which consisted
 mainly of garment production, boat building, and handicrafts accounted
 for about 6% of GDP.

Economy

 Overview: Mali is among the poorest countries in the world, with 65%
 of its land area desert or semidesert. Economic activity is largely
 confined to the riverine area irrigated by the Niger. About 10% of the
 population is nomadic and some 80% of the labor force is engaged in
 agriculture and fishing. Industrial activity is concentrated on
 processing farm commodities. The economy is beginning to turn around
 after contracting through 1992-93, largely because of enhanced exports
 and import substitute production in the wake of the 50% devaluation of
 January 1994. Post-devaluation inflation appears to have peaked at 35%
 in 1994 and the government appears to be keeping on track with its IMF
 structural adjustment program.

Economy

 Overview: Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic
 location, and a productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20%
 of its food needs, has limited freshwater supplies, and has no
 domestic energy sources. Consequently, the economy is highly dependent
 on foreign trade and services. Manufacturing and tourism are the
 largest contributors to the economy. Manufacturing accounts for about
 24% of GDP, with the electronics and textile industries major
 contributors and with the state-owned Malta drydocks employing about
 4,300 people. In 1994, over 1,000,000 tourists visited the island. Per
 capita GDP of $10,760 places Malta in the range of the less affluent
 EU countries.

Economy

 Overview: Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors
 of the economy. The government's policy of offering incentives to
 high-technology companies and financial institutions to locate on the
 island has paid off in expanding employment opportunities in
 high-income industries. As a result, agriculture and fishing, once the
 mainstays of the economy, have declined in their shares of GDP.
 Banking now contributes about 45% to GDP. Trade is mostly with the UK.

Economy

 Overview: The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and
 light industry. Agriculture accounts for about 10% of GDP and the
 small industrial sector for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with
 most of the sugarcane now used for the production of rum. Banana
 exports are increasing, going mostly to France. The bulk of meat,
 vegetable, and grain requirements must be imported, contributing to a
 chronic trade deficit that requires large annual transfers of aid from
 France. Tourism has become more important than agricultural exports as
 a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the work force is
 employed in the service sector and in administration. Banana workers
 launched protests late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and
 fears of greater competition in the European market from other
 producers.

Economy

 Overview: A majority of the population still depends on agriculture
 and livestock for a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and
 many subsistence farmers were forced into the cities by recurrent
 droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. Mauritania has extensive deposits of
 iron ore, which account for almost 50% of total exports. The decline
 in world demand for this ore, however, has led to cutbacks in
 production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest fishing
 areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens this
 key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near
 Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and economic
 mismanagement have resulted in a substantial buildup of foreign debt.
 The government has begun the second stage of an economic reform
 program in consultation with the World Bank, the IMF, and major donor
 countries. Short-term growth prospects are gloomy because of the heavy
 debt service burden, rapid population growth, and vulnerability to
 climatic conditions.

 low income, agriculturally based economy to middle income diversified
 economy with growing industrial and tourist sectors. For most of the
 period annual growth has been of the order of 5% to 6%. This
 remarkable achievement has been reflected in increased life
 expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much improved
 infrastructure. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land
 area and accounts for 40% of export earnings. The government's

 modernization and to exports), agricultural diversification, and
 tourism. Economic performance in 1991-93 continued strong with solid
 real growth and low unemployment.

Economy

 Overview: Mexico, under the guidance of new President Ernesto ZEDILLO,
 entered 1995 in the midst of a severe financial crisis. Mexico's
 membership in the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the
 United States and Canada, its solid record of economic reforms, and
 its strong growth in the second and third quarters of 1994 - at an
 annual rate of 3.8% and 4.5% respectively - seemed to augur bright
 prospects for 1995. However, an overvalued exchange rate and widening
 current account deficits created an imbalance that ultimately proved
 unsustainable. To finance the trade gap, Mexico City had become
 increasingly reliant on volatile portfolio investment. A series of
 political shocks in 1994 - an uprising in the southern state of
 Chiapas, the assassination of a presidential candidate, several high
 profile kidnappings, the killing of a second high-level political
 figure, and renewed threats from the Chiapas rebels - combined with
 rising international interest rates and concerns of a devaluation to
 undermine investor confidence and prompt massive outflows of capital.
 The dwindling of foreign exchange reserves, which the central bank had
 been using to defend the currency, forced the new administration to
 change the exchange rate policy and allow the currency to float freely
 in the last days of 1994. The adjustment roiled Mexican financial
 markets, leading to a 30% to 40% weakening of the peso relative to the
 dollar. ZEDILLO announced an emergency economic program that included
 federal budget cuts and plans for more privatizations, but it failed
 to restore investor confidence quickly. While the devaluation is
 likely to help Mexican exporters, whose products are now cheaper, it
 also raises the specter of an inflationary spiral if domestic
 producers increase their prices and workers demand wage hikes.
 Although strong economic fundamentals bode well for Mexico's
 longer-term outlook, prospects for solid growth and low inflation have
 deteriorated considerably, at least through 1995.

Economy

 Overview: Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming
 and fishing. The islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting,
 except for high-grade phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry
 exists, but the remoteness of the location and a lack of adequate
 facilities hinder development. Financial assistance from the US is the
 primary source of revenue, with the US pledged to spend $1 billion in
 the islands in the 1990s. Geographical isolation and a poorly
 developed infrastructure are major impediments to long-term growth.

Economy

 Overview: Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has
 no major mineral deposits. As a result, Moldova's economy is primarily
 based on agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco.
 Moldova must import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and natural gas,
 and energy shortages have contributed to sharp production declines
 since the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The Moldovan government
 is making steady progress on an ambitious economic reform agenda, and
 the IMF has called Moldova a model for the region. As part of its
 reform efforts, Chisinau has introduced a stable currency, freed all
 prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to state enterprises and
 backed their steady privatization, removed export controls, and freed
 interest rates. Chisinau appears strongly committed to continuing
 these reforms in 1995. Meanwhile, privatization of medium and large
 enterprises got underway in mid-1994 and is expected to pick up speed
 in 1995. To improve its precarious energy situation, Chisinau reached
 an agreement with Moscow in December 1994 on gas deliveries for 1995.
 Gazprom, Russia's national gas company, has agreed to reduce prices
 for natural gas deliveries to Moldova from the world market price of
 $80/thousand cubic meters (tcm) to $58/tcm in return for part
 ownership of the Moldovan pipeline system.

Economy

 Overview: Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a
 popular resort, attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant
 climate. The Principality has successfully sought to diversify into
 services and small, high-value-added, nonpolluting industries. The
 state has no income tax and low business taxes and thrives as a tax
 haven both for individuals who have established residence and for
 foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices. About 50%
 of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,
 banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from
 tourism. Living standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to
 those in prosperous French metropolitan suburbs.

Economy

 Overview: Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide
 expanses of unproductive land have constrained economic development.
 Economic activity traditionally has been based on agriculture and the
 breeding of livestock. In past years extensive mineral resources had
 been developed with Soviet support; total Soviet assistance at its
 height amounted to 30% of GDP. The mining and processing of coal,
 copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold account for a large part
 of industrial production. Timber and fishing are also important
 sectors. The Mongolian leadership has been gradually making the
 transition from Soviet-style central planning to a market economy
 through privatization and price reform, and is soliciting support from
 international financial agencies and foreign investors. The economy,
 however, has still not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid, and the
 country continues to suffer substantial economic hardships, with
 one-fourth of the population below the poverty line.

Economy

 Overview: Morocco faces the typical problems of developing countries -
 restraining government spending, reducing constraints on private
 activity and foreign trade, and keeping inflation within bounds. Since
 the early 1980s the government has pursued an economic program toward
 these objectives with the support of the IMF, the World Bank, and the
 Paris Club of creditors. The economy has substantial assets to draw
 on: the world's largest phosphate reserves, diverse agricultural and
 fishing resources, a sizable tourist industry, a growing manufacturing
 sector, and remittances from Moroccans working abroad. A severe
 drought in 1992-93 depressed economic activity and held down exports.
 Real GDP contracted by 4.4% in 1992 and 1.1% in 1993. Despite these
 setbacks, initiatives to relax capital controls, strengthen the
 banking sector, and privatize state enterprises went forward in
 1993-94. Favorable rainfall in 1994 boosted agricultural production by
 40%. Servicing the large debt, high unemployment, and vulnerability to
 external economic forces remain long-term problems for Morocco.

Economy

 Overview: One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to
 exploit the economic potential of its sizable agricultural,
 hydropower, and transportation resources. Indeed, national output,
 consumption, and investment declined throughout the first half of the
 1980s because of internal disorders, lack of government administrative
 control, and a growing foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid,
 attracted by an economic reform policy, resulted in successive years
 of economic growth in the late 1980s, but aid has declined steadily
 since 1989. Agricultural output is at only 75% of its 1981 level, and
 grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 20%-40% of
 capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep
 afloat. Peace accords signed in October 1992 improved chances of
 foreign investment, aided IMF-supported economic reforms, and
 supported continued economic recovery. Elections held in 1994 diverted
 government attention from the economy, resulting in slippage and
 delays in the economic reform program. Nonetheless, growth in 1994 was
 solid and can continue into the late 1990s given continued foreign
 help in meeting debt obligations.

Economy

 Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry to
 extract and process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost
 25% of GDP. Namibia is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals
 in Africa and the world's fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial
 diamond deposits are among the richest in the world, making Namibia a
 primary source for gem-quality diamonds. Namibia also produces large
 quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver, and tungsten. More than half
 the population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence
 agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must import some of its food.

Economy

 Overview: Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of
 which are expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have
 given Nauruans one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third
 World. Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be
 imported, including fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of
 mined land and the replacement of income from phosphates are serious
 long-term problems. Substantial amounts of phosphate income are
 invested in trust funds to help cushion the transition.

Economy

 Overview: Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in
 the world. Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a
 livelihood for over 90% of the population and accounting for half of
 GDP. Industrial activity is limited, mainly involving the processing
 of agricultural produce (jute, sugarcane, tobacco, and grain).
 Production of textiles and carpets has expanded recently and accounted
 for 85% of foreign exchange earnings in FY93/94. Apart from
 agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural resources are mica,
 hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production in the late 1980s
 grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population growth of 2.6%.
 More than 40% of the population is undernourished. Since May 1991, the
 government has been encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by
 eliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order
 to simplify domestic and foreign investment. The government also has
 been cutting public expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing
 state industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for foreign
 trade and investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of the
 small size of the economy, its technological backwardness, its
 remoteness, and susceptibility to natural disaster. The international
 community provides funding for 70% of Nepal's developmental budget and
 for 30% of total budgetary expenditures. The government, realizing
 that attempts to reverse three years of liberalization would
 jeopardize this vital support, almost certainly will move ahead with
 its reform program in 1995-96.

Economy

 Overview: This highly developed and affluent economy is based on
 private enterprise. The government makes its presence felt, however,
 through many regulations, permit requirements, and welfare programs
 affecting most aspects of economic activity. The trade and financial
 services sector contributes over 50% of GDP. Industrial activity
 provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the food-processing,
 oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly mechanized
 agricultural sector employs only 4% of the labor force, but provides
 large surpluses for export and the domestic food-processing industry.
 Indeed the Netherlands ranks third worldwide in value of agricultural
 exports, behind the US and France. High unemployment and a sizable
 budget deficit are currently the most serious economic problems. Many
 of the economic issues of the 1990s will reflect the course of
 European economic integration.

Economy

 Overview: Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian
 economy dependent on a guaranteed British market to a more
 industrialized, open free market economy that can compete on the
 global scene. The government has hoped that dynamic growth would boost
 real incomes, broaden and deepen the technological capabilities of the
 industrial sector, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the
 expansion of welfare benefits. The initial results were mixed:
 inflation is down from double-digit levels, but growth was sluggish in
 1988-91. In 1992-93, growth picked up to 3% annually, a sign that the
 new economic approach was beginning to pay off. Business confidence
 strengthened in 1994, and export demand picked up in the Asia-Pacific
 region, resulting in 6.2% growth. Inflation remains among the lowest
 in the industrial world.

Economy

 Overview: Since March 1991, when President CHAMORRO began an ambitious
 economic stabilization program, Nicaragua has had considerable success
 in reducing inflation and obtaining substantial economic aid from
 abroad. Annual inflation fell from more than 750% in 1991 to less than
 5% in 1992. Inflation rose again to an estimated 20% in 1993, although
 this increase was due almost entirely to a large currency devaluation
 in January. As of early 1994, the government was close to finalizing
 an enhanced structural adjustment facility with the IMF, after the
 previous standby facility expired in early 1993. Despite these
 successes, achieving overall economic growth in an economy scarred by
 misguided economic values and civil war during the 1980s has proved
 elusive. Economic growth was flat in 1992 and slightly negative in
 1993. Nicaragua's per capita foreign debt is one of the highest in the
 world; nonetheless, as of late 1993, Nicaragua was current on its
 post-1988 debt as well as on payments to the international financial
 institutions. Definition of property rights remains a problem;
 ownership disputes over large tracts of land, businesses, and homes
 confiscated by the previous government have yet to be resolved. A rise
 in exports of coffee and other products led growth in 1994.

Economy

 Overview: Niger is one of the world's poorest countries, with GDP
 growth lagging behind the rapid growth of population. The economy is
 centered on subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry, and reexport
 trade, and increasingly less on uranium, its major export throughout
 the 1970s and 1980s. Uranium revenues dropped by almost 50% between
 1983 and 1990 with the end of the uranium boom. Terms of trade with
 Nigeria, Niger's largest regional trade partner, have improved
 dramatically since the 50% devaluation of the African franc in January
 1994; this devaluation boosted exports of livestock, peas, onions, and
 the products of Niger's small cotton industry. The government relies
 on bilateral and multilateral aid for operating expenses and public
 investment and is strongly induced to adhere to structural adjustment
 programs designed by the IMF and the World Bank.

Economy

 Overview: The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be hobbled by
 political instability and poor macroeconomic management. Nigeria's
 unpopular military rulers show no sign of wanting to restore
 democratic civilian rule in the near future and appear divided on how
 to redress fundamental economic imbalances that cause troublesome
 inflation and the steady depreciation of the naira. The government's
 domestic and international arrears continue to limit economic growth -
 even in the oil sector - and prevent an agreement with the IMF and
 bilateral creditors on debt relief. The inefficient (largely
 subsistence) agricultural sector has failed to keep up with rapid
 population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now
 must import food.

Economy

 Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand.
 Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall
 made up by grants from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages
 to public employees. The agricultural sector consists mainly of
 subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export.
 Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion
 fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps
 to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in
 recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of
 migration of Niueans to New Zealand.

Economy

 Overview: The primary economic activity is tourism, which has brought
 a level of prosperity unusual among inhabitants of the Pacific
 islands. The number of visitors has increased steadily over the years

Economy

 Overview: The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance
 from the US. The rate of funding has declined as locally generated
 government revenues have grown. An agreement for the years 1986 to
 1992 entitled the islands to $228 million for capital development,
 government operations, and special programs. A rapidly growing major
 source of income is the tourist industry, which now employs about 50%
 of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural
 sector is of minor importance and is made up of cattle ranches and
 small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons.
 Industry is small scale, mostly handicrafts, light manufacturing, and
 garment production.

Economy

 Overview: Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free
 market activity and government intervention. The government controls
 key areas, such as the vital petroleum sector (through large-scale
 state enterprises) and extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing,
 and areas with sparse resources. Norway also maintains an extensive
 welfare system that helps propel public sector expenditures to
 slightly more than 50% of the GDP and results in one of the highest
 average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small country with a high
 dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of
 raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and
 medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations.
 The country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum,
 hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on
 its oil sector to keep its economy afloat. Norway imports more than
 half its food needs. Although one of the government's main priorities
 is to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve
 for years to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment
 and strengthen and diversify the economy through tax reform and a
 series of expansionary budgets. The budget deficit is expected to hit
 a record 8% of GDP because of welfare spending and bail-outs of the
 banking system. Unemployment is currently running at 8.4% - including
 those in job programs - because of the weakness of the economy outside
 the oil sector. Economic growth, only 1.6% in 1993, moved up to 5.5%
 in 1994. Oslo opted to stay out of the EU during a referendum in
 November 1994.

Economy

 Overview: Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes of the
 oil industry, including trends in international oil prices and the
 ability of OPEC producers to agree on output quotas. Petroleum
 accounts for more than 85% of export earnings, about 80% of government
 revenues, and roughly 40% of GDP. Oman has proved oil reserves of 4
 billion barrels, equivalent to about 20 years' supply at the current
 rate of extraction. Agriculture is carried on at a subsistence level
 and the general population depends on imported food. The government is
 encouraging private investment, both domestic and foreign, as a prime
 force for further economic development.

 Philippine Sea and South China Sea
 natural hazards: surrounded by a zone of violent volcanic and
 earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring of Fire;
 subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in southeast and east Asia
 from May to December (most frequent from July to October); tropical
 cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike Central
 America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and
 September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from
 Antarctica; occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru
 when the trade winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent
 moves south, killing the plankton that is the primary food source for
 anchovies; consequently, the anchovies move to better feeding grounds,
 causing resident marine birds to starve by the thousands because of
 their lost food source; ships subject to superstructure icing in
 extreme north from October to May and in extreme south from May to
 October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific can be a maritime
 hazard from June to December
 international agreements: NA

 Note: the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal,
 Luzon Strait, and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the
 Pacific Ocean into the North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific
 Ocean; dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in

Economy

 Overview: The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world
 economy and particularly to those nations its waters directly touch.
 It provides low-cost sea transportation between East and West,
 extensive fishing grounds, offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and
 sand and gravel for the construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%)
 of the world's fish catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the
 only ocean where the fish catch has increased every year since 1978.
 Exploitation of offshore oil and gas reserves is playing an
 ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of Australia, NZ, China,
 US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas,
 combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has
 slowed but not stopped new drillings.

Economy

 Overview: The Pakistani economy has made progress in several key areas
 since Benazir BHUTTO became Prime Minister in October 1993. She has
 been under pressure from international donors and the IMF - which gave
 Pakistan a $1.3 billion structural adjustment credit in February 1994
 - to continue the economic reforms and austerity measures begun by her
 predecessor, caretaker Prime Minister Moeen QURESHI (July-October
 1993). Foreign exchange reserves climbed to more than $3 billion in
 1994, and the budget deficit was substantially reduced. Real GDP
 growth was 4% in FY93/94, up from 2.3% in FY92/93. Foreign direct and
 portfolio investment also have increased. Privatization of large
 public sector utilities began in 1994 with the sale of 12% of the
 Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and the Water and Power
 Development Authority (WAPDA); the sale of state-owned banks and other
 large units are planned for 1995. Still, the government must cope with
 long-standing economic vulnerabilities - high levels of debt service
 and defense spending, a small tax base, a huge population, and
 dependence on cotton-based exports - which hamper its ability to
 create a stable economic environment. In addition, Pakistan's
 infrastructure is inadequate and deteriorating, low levels of literacy
 constrain industrial growth, and increasing sectarian, ethnic, and
 tribal violence disrupt production.

Economy

 Overview: The economy consists primarily of subsistence agriculture
 and fishing. The government is the major employer of the work force,
 relying heavily on financial assistance from the US. The compact of
 "free association" with the United States, entered into after the end
 of the UN trusteeship on 1 October 1994, provides Palau with $500
 million in US aid over 15 years in return for furnishing some military
 facilities. The population, in effect, enjoys a per capita income of
 $5,000, twice that of the Philippines and much of Micronesia. Long-run
 prospects for the tourist sector have been greatly bolstered by the
 expansion of air travel in the Pacific and the rapidly rising
 prosperity of leading East Asian countries.

Economy

 Overview: Because of its key geographic location, Panama's economy is
 service-based, heavily weighted toward banking, commerce, and tourism.
 Trade and financial ties with the US are especially close. GDP grew at
 3.6% in 1994, a respectable rate, yet below the 7.1% average of the
 early 1990s. Banking and financial services and trade through the
 Colon Free Zone continued to expand rapidly, with the industrial and
 agricultural sectors experiencing little growth. The new
 administration, inaugurated 1 September 1994, has launched an economic
 plan designed to reverse rising unemployment, attract foreign
 investment, cut back the size of government, and modernize the
 economy. The success of the plan in meeting its goals for 1995 and
 beyond depends largely on the success of the administration in
 reforming the labor code and instituting the reforms necessary to join
 the GATT.

Economy

 Overview: Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources,
 but exploitation has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high
 cost of developing an infrastructure. Agriculture provides a
 subsistence livelihood for 85% of the population. Mining of numerous
 deposits, including copper and gold, accounts for about 60% of export
 earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and development aid under
 World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. Robust growth in
 1991-92 was led by the mining sector; the opening of a large new gold
 mine helped the advance. At the start of 1995, Port Moresby is looking
 primarily to the exploitation of mineral and petroleum resources to
 drive economic development but new prospecting in Papua New Guinea has
 slumped as other mineral-rich countries have stepped up their
 competition for international investment. Output from current projects
 will probably begin to taper off in 1996, but no new large ventures
 are being developed to succeed them.

Economy

 Overview: Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of
 GDP, employs about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of
 exports, in which soybeans and cotton are the most important. Paraguay
 lacks substantial mineral or petroleum resources but possesses a large
 hydropower potential. In a major step to increase its economic
 activity in the region, Paraguay in March 1991 joined the Southern
 Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes Brazil, Argentina, and
 Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an unorthodox approach,
 reduced external debt with both commercial and official creditors by
 purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt in the
 secondary market at a substantial discount. The government had paid
 100% of remaining official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France,
 and Spain. All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the
 long run, the government must press forward with general,
 market-oriented economic reforms. Growth of 3.5% in 1993 was spurred
 by higher-than-expected agricultural output and rising international
 commodity prices. Inflation picked up steam in fourth quarter 1993
 because of rises in public sector salaries and utility rates. GDP
 growth continued in 1994 at 3.5%. Although inflation declined a bit
 over 1993, increases in food prices, and crop and infrastructure
 damage from heavy rains at the end of the year, forced inflation to
 18%, above the government's target of 15%. Paraguay reaffirmed its
 commitment to MERCOSUR on 1 January 1995 by implementing the
 organization's common external tariff.

 note: the 1979 Constitution mandated the creation of regions
 (regiones, singular - region) to function eventually as autonomous
 economic and administrative entities; so far, 12 regions have been
 constituted from 23 of the 24 departments - Amazonas (from Loreto),
 Andres Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from
 Arequipa), Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from
 Cusco, Madre de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los

 (from Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del Maranon (from
 Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin (from San Martin),
 Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has been delayed
 by the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to merge
 with the department of Lima; because of inadequate funding from the
 central government and organizational and political difficulties, the
 regions have yet to assume major responsibilities; the 1993
 Constitution retains the regions but limits their authority; the 1993
 Constitution also reaffirms the roles of departmental and municipal

Economy

 Overview: The Peruvian economy has become increasingly
 market-oriented, with major privatizations completed in 1994 in the
 mining and telecommunications industries. In the 1980s the economy
 suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita output, and
 mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World Bank
 support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An
 austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government
 took office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly
 contraction of economic activity, but the slide came to a halt late
 that year, and in 1991 output rose 2.4%. After a burst of inflation as
 the austerity program eliminated government price subsidies, monthly
 price increases eased to the single-digit level and by December 1991
 dropped to the lowest increase since mid-1987. Lima obtained a
 financial rescue package from multilateral lenders in September 1991,
 although it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external debt. By
 working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and
 arrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March
 1993. In 1992, GDP had fallen by 2.8%, in part because a
 warmer-than-usual El Nino current resulted in a 30% drop in the fish
 catch, but the economy rebounded as strong foreign investment helped
 push growth to 6% in 1993 and 8.6% in 1994.

Economy

 Overview: Domestic output in this primarily agricultural economy
 failed to grow in 1992 and rose only slightly in 1993. Drought and
 power supply problems hampered production, while inadequate revenues
 prevented government pump priming. Worker remittances helped to
 supplement GDP. A marked increase in capital goods imports,
 particularly power generating equipment, telecommunications equipment,
 and electronic data processors, contributed to 20% annual import
 growth in 1992-94. Provided the government can cope with the
 substantial trade deficit and meet the fiscal targets agreed to with
 the IMF, the Philippines should duplicate the strong growth
 performance of 1994 in 1995-96.

Economy

 Overview: Poland continues to make good progress in the difficult
 transition to a market economy that began on 1 January 1990, when the
 new democratic government instituted "shock therapy" by decontrolling
 prices, slashing subsidies, and drastically reducing import barriers.
 Real GDP fell sharply in 1990 and 1991, but in 1992 Poland became the
 first country in the region to resume economic growth with a 2.6%
 increase. Growth increased to 3.8% in 1993 and 5.5% in 1994 - the
 highest rate in Europe except for Albania. All of the growth since
 1991 has come from the booming private sector, which now accounts for
 at least 55% of GDP, even though privatization of the state-owned
 enterprises is proceeding slowly and most industry remains in state
 hands. Industrial production increased 12% in 1994 - led by 50% jumps
 in the output of motor vehicles, radios and televisions, and pulp and
 paper - and is now well above the 1990 level. Inflation, which had
 approached 1,200% annually in early 1990, was down to about 30% in
 1994, as the government held the budget deficit to 1.5% of GDP. After
 five years of steady increases, unemployment has leveled off at about
 16% nationwide, although it approaches 30% in some regions. The trade
 deficit was sharply reduced in 1994, due mainly to increased exports
 to Western Europe, Poland's main customer. The leftist government
 elected in September 1993 gets generally good marks from foreign
 observers for its management of the budget but is often criticized for
 not moving faster on privatization.

Economy

 Overview: Portugal's economy contracted 0.4% in 1993 but registered a
 1.4% growth in 1994, with 3% growth expected in 1995 and 1996. This
 comeback rests on high levels of public investment, continuing strong
 export growth, and a gradual recovery in consumer spending. The
 government's long-run economic goal is the modernization of Portuguese
 markets, industry, infrastructure, and work force in order to catch up
 with productivity and income levels of the more advanced EU countries.
 Per capita income now equals only 55% of the EU average. Economic
 policy in 1994 focused on reducing inflationary pressures by lowering
 the fiscal deficit, maintaining a stable escudo, moderating wage
 increases, and encouraging increased competition. The government's
 medium-term objective is to be in the first tier of the EU countries
 eligible to join the economic and monetary union (EMU) as early as
 1997. To this end, the 1995 budget posits a cut in total deficit to
 5.8% of GDP.

Economy

 Overview: Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the
 Caribbean region. Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary
 sector of economic activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access
 to the US and by tax incentives, US firms have invested heavily in
 Puerto Rico since the 1950s. US minimum wage laws apply. Important
 industries include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles,
 petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to
 dairy production and other livestock products as the main source of
 income in the agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an
 important source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of
 nearly 3.9 million tourists in 1993.

Economy

 Overview: Oil is the backbone of the economy and accounts for more
 than 30% of GDP, roughly 75% of export earnings, and 70% of government
 revenues. Proved oil reserves of 3.3 billion barrels should ensure
 continued output at current levels for about 25 years. Oil has given
 Qatar a per capita GDP comparable to the leading West European
 industrial countries. Production and export of natural gas are
 becoming increasingly important. Long-term goals feature the
 development of off-shore oil and the diversification of the economy.

Economy

 Overview: The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture.
 Sugarcane has been the primary crop for more than a century, and in
 some years it accounts for 85% of exports. The government has been
 pushing the development of a tourist industry to relieve high
 unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third of the labor force.
 The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is extraordinary
 and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and Indian
 communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
 population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous
 groups suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer
 nations of the African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in
 February 1991 illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions.
 The economic well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued
 financial assistance from France.

Economy

 Overview: Despite the continuing difficulties in moving away from the
 former command system, the Romanian economy seems to have bottomed out
 in 1993-94. Market oriented reforms have been introduced fitfully
 since the downfall of CEAUSESCU in December 1989, with the result a
 growing private sector, especially in services. The slow pace of
 structural reform, however, has exacerbated Romania's high inflation
 rate and eroded real wages. Agricultural production rebounded in 1993
 from the drought-reduced harvest of 1992. The economy continued its
 recovery in 1994, further gains being realized in agriculture,
 construction, services, and trade. Food supplies are adequate but
 expensive. Romania's infrastructure had deteriorated over the last
 five years due to reduced levels of public investment. Residents of
 the capital reported frequent disruptions of heating and water
 services. The slow and painful process of conversion to a more open
 economy will continue in 1995.

Economy

 Overview: Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural resources, a
 well-educated population, and a diverse industrial base, continues to
 experience formidable difficulties in moving from its old centrally
 planned economy to a modern market economy. President YEL'TSIN's
 government has made substantial strides in converting to a market
 economy since launching its economic reform program in January 1992 by
 freeing nearly all prices, slashing defense spending, eliminating the
 old centralized distribution system, completing an ambitious voucher
 privatization program, establishing private financial institutions,
 and decentralizing foreign trade. Russia, however, has made little
 progress in a number of key areas that are needed to provide a solid
 foundation for the transition to a market economy. Financial
 stabilization has remained elusive, with wide swings in monthly
 inflation rates. Only limited restructuring of industry has occurred
 so far because of a scarcity of investment funds and the failure of
 enterprise managers to make hard cost-cutting decisions. In addition,
 Moscow has yet to develop a social safety net that would allow faster
 restructuring by relieving enterprises of the burden of providing
 social benefits for their workers and has been slow to develop the
 legal framework necessary to fully support a market economy and to
 encourage foreign investment. As a result, output has continued to
 fall. According to Russian official data, which probably overstate the
 fall, GDP declined by 15% in 1994 compared with a 12% decline in 1993.
 Industrial output in 1994 fell 21% with all major sectors taking a
 hit. Agricultural production in 1994 was down 9%. The grain harvest
 totaled 81 million tons, some 15 million tons less than in 1993.
 Unemployment climbed to an estimated 6.6 million or about 7% of the
 work force by yearend 1994. Floundering Russian firms have already had
 to put another 4.8 million workers on involuntary, unpaid leave or
 shortened workweeks. Government fears of large-scale unemployment
 continued to hamper industrial restructuring efforts. According to
 official Russian data, real per capita income was up nearly 18% in
 1994 compared with 1993, in part because many Russians are working
 second jobs. Most Russians perceive that they are worse off now
 because of growing crime and health problems and mounting wage
 arrears. Russia has made significant headway in privatizing state
 assets, completing its voucher privatization program at midyear 1994.
 At least a portion of about 110,000 state enterprises were transferred
 to private hands by the end of 1994. Including partially privatized
 firms, the private sector accounted for roughly half of GDP in 1994.
 Financial stabilization continued to remain a challenge for the
 government. Moscow tightened financial policies in late 1993 and early
 1994, including postponing planned budget spending, and succeeded in
 reducing monthly inflation from 18% in January to about 5% in July and
 August. At midyear, however, the government relaxed austerity measures
 in the face of mounting pressure from industry and agriculture,
 sparking a new round of inflation; the monthly inflation rate jumped
 to roughly 15% per month during the fourth quarter. In response,
 Moscow announced a fairly tight government budget for 1995 designed to
 bring monthly inflation down to around 1% by the end of 1995.
 According to official statistics, Russia's 1994 trade with nations
 outside the former Soviet Union produced a $12.3 billion surplus, up
 from $11.3 billion in 1993. Foreign sales - comprised largely of oil,
 natural gas, and other raw materials - grew more than 8%. Imports also
 were up 8% as demand for food and other consumer goods surged. Russian
 trade with other former Soviet republics continued to decline. At the
 same time, Russia paid only a fraction of the roughly $20 billion in
 debt that came due in 1994, and by the end of the year, Russia's hard
 currency foreign debt had risen to nearly $100 billion. Moscow reached
 agreement to restructure debts with Paris Club official creditors in
 mid-1994 and concluded a preliminary deal with its commercial bank
 creditors late in the year to reschedule debts owed them in early
 1995. Capital flight continued to be a serious problem in 1994, with
 billions of additional dollars in assets being moved abroad, primarily
 to bank accounts in Europe. Russia's physical plant continues to
 deteriorate because of insufficient maintenance and new construction.
 Plant and equipment on average are twice the age of the West's. Many
 years will pass before Russia can take full advantage of its natural
 resources and its human assets.

 Defense expenditures: $NA, NA% of GDP
 note: the Intelligence Community estimates that defense spending in
 Russia fell about 15% in real terms in 1994, reducing Russian defense
 outlays to about one-fourth of peak Soviet levels in the late 1980s;
 although Russia may still spend as much as 10% of its GDP on defense,
 this is significantly below the 15% to 17% burden the former USSR
 carried during much of the 1980s; conversion of military expenditures
 into US dollars using the current exchange rate could produce
 misleading results

Economy

 Overview: Rwanda is a poor African nation suffering bitterly from
 ethnic-based civil war. Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural
 sector; coffee and tea make up 80%-90% of total exports. The amount of
 fertile land is limited, however, and deforestation and soil erosion
 continue to create problems. The industrial sector in Rwanda is small,
 contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses mainly on the
 processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy remains
 dependent on coffee/tea exports and foreign aid. Weak international
 prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita
 GDP to decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank
 began in October 1990. Ethnic-based insurgency since 1990 has
 devastated wide areas, especially in the north, and displaced hundreds
 of thousands of people. A peace accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended
 most of the fighting, but massive resumption of civil warfare in April
 1994 in the capital city Kigali and elsewhere has been taking
 thousands of lives and severely affecting short-term economic
 prospects. The economy suffers massively from failure to maintain the
 infrastructure, looting, neglect of important cash crops, and lack of
 health care facilities.

Economy

 Overview: The economy has traditionally depended on the growing and
 processing of sugarcane; decreasing world prices have hurt the
 industry in recent years. Tourism and export-oriented manufacturing

 for 7% and 4% of GDP respectively. Growth in the construction and
 tourism sectors spurred the economic expansion in 1994. Most food is
 imported.

Economy

 Overview: Though foreign investment in manufacturing and information
 processing in recent years has increased Saint Lucia's industrial
 base, the economy remains vulnerable due to its heavy dependence on
 banana production, which is subject to periodic droughts and tropical
 storms. Indeed, the destructive effect of Tropical Storm Debbie in
 mid-1994 caused the loss of 60% of the year's banana crop. Increased
 competition from Latin American bananas will probably further reduce
 market prices, exacerbating Saint Lucia's need to diversify its
 economy in coming years, e.g., by expanding tourism, manufacturing,
 and construction

Economy

 Overview: The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood
 by fishing and by servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of
 Newfoundland. The economy has been declining, however, because the
 number of ships stopping at Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the
 years. In March 1989, an agreement between France and Canada set fish
 quotas for Saint Pierre's trawlers fishing in Canadian and
 Canadian-claimed waters for three years. The agreement settles a
 longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish exports to a
 halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports come
 primarily from Canada and France.

Economy

 Overview: Agriculture, dominated by banana production, is the most
 important sector of the economy. The services sector, based mostly on
 a growing tourist industry, is also important. In 1993, economic
 growth slowed to 1.4%, reflecting a sharp decline in agricultural
 production caused by drought. The government has been relatively
 unsuccessful at introducing new industries, and high unemployment
 rates of 35%-40% continue.

Economy

 Overview: This small poor island economy has remained dependent on
 cocoa since independence 20 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa
 production has gradually declined because of drought and
 mismanagement, so that by 1987 annual output had fallen from 10,000
 tons to 3,900 tons. As a result, a shortage of cocoa for export has
 created a serious balance-of-payments problem. Production of less
 important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm kernels, has also
 declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of exports by a
 ratio of 4:1 or more. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
 of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food
 needs. It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods.
 Over the years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt
 and has had to depend on concessional aid and debt rescheduling.
 Considerable potential exists for development of a tourist industry,
 and the government has taken steps to expand facilities in recent
 years. The government also has attempted to reduce price controls and
 subsidies and to encourage market-based mechanisms, e. g., to
 facilitate the distribution of imported food. Annual GDP growth is
 estimated in the 3%-4% range for 1994-96.

Economy

 Overview: This is a well-to-do oil-based economy with strong
 government controls over major economic activities. About 46% of GDP
 comes from the private sector. Economic (as well as political) ties
 with the US are especially strong. The petroleum sector accounts for
 roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of GDP, and almost all export
 earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of petroleum in the
 world (26% of the proved total), ranks as the largest exporter of
 petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the
 government intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit
 since 1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic
 activity. Roughly four million foreign workers play an important role
 in the Saudi economy, for example, in the oil and banking sectors. For
 about a decade, Saudi Arabia's domestic and international outlays have
 outstripped its income, and the government has cut its foreign
 assistance and is beginning to rein in domestic programs. For 1995,
 the country looks for improvement in oil prices and will continue its
 policies of restraining public spending and encouraging non-oil
 exports.

Economy

 Overview: In 1994 Senegal embarked on its most concerted structural
 adjustment effort yet to exploit the 50% devaluation of the currencies
 of the 14 Francophone African nations on 12 January. After years of
 foot-dragging, the government finally passed a liberalized labor code
 which should significantly help lower the cost of labor and improve
 the manufacturing sector's competitiveness. Inroads also have been
 made in closing tax loopholes and eliminating monopoly power in
 several sectors. At the same time the government is holding the line
 on current fiscal expenditure under the watchful eyes of international
 organizations on which it depends for substantial support. A bumper
 peanut crop - Senegal's main source of foreign exchange - coincided
 with an improvement of international prices and probably resulted in a
 doubling of earnings in 1994 over 1993. The country's narrow resource
 base, environmental degradation, and untamed population growth will
 continue to hold back growth in living standards over the medium term.

Economy

 Overview: The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in 1991 has
 been followed by bloody ethnic warfare, the destabilization of
 republic boundaries, and the breakup of important interrepublic trade
 flows. Serbia and Montenegro faces major economic problems; output has
 dropped sharply, particularly in 1993. First, like the other former
 Yugoslav republics, it depended on its sister republics for large
 amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and manufactures. Wide
 differences in climate, mineral resources, and levels of technology
 among the republics accentuated this interdependence, as did the
 communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
 number of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the
 sharp drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets,
 and the destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have
 contributed to the economic difficulties of the republics. One
 singular factor in the economic situation of Serbia and Montenegro is
 the continuation in office of a communist government that is primarily
 interested in political and military mastery, not economic reform. A
 further complication is the imposition of economic sanctions by the UN
 in 1992. Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of a new currency
 unit in June 1993; prices were relatively stable in 1994. Reliable
 statistics are hard to come by; the GDP estimate of $1,000 per capita
 in 1994 is extremely rough. Output in 1994 seems to have leveled off
 after the plunge in 1993.

 appliances), electronics, petroleum products, chemicals, and
 pharmaceuticals

 Agriculture: the fertile plains of Vojvodina produce 80% of the cereal
 production of the former Yugoslavia and most of the cotton, oilseeds,
 and chicory; Vojvodina also produces fodder crops to support intensive
 beef and dairy production; Serbia proper, although hilly, has a
 well-distributed rainfall and a long growing season; produces fruit,
 grapes, and cereals; in this area, livestock production (sheep and
 cattle) and dairy farming prosper; Kosovo produces fruits, vegetables,
 tobacco, and a small amount of cereals; the mountainous pastures of
 Kosovo and Montenegro support sheep and goat husbandry; Montenegro has
 only a small agriculture sector, mostly near the coast where a
 Mediterranean climate permits the culture of olives, citrus, grapes,
 and rice

Economy

 Overview: Since independence in 1976, per capita output has grown to
 roughly seven times the old near-subsistence level, led by the tourist
 sector, which employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more
 than 70% of hard currency earnings. In recent years the government has
 encouraged foreign investment in order to upgrade hotels and other
 services. At the same time, the government has moved to reduce the
 high dependence on tourism by promoting the development of farming,
 fishing, and small-scale manufacturing. The vulnerability of the
 tourist sector was illustrated by the sharp drop in 1991-92 due
 largely to the Gulf war. Although the industry has rebounded, the
 government recognizes the continuing need for upgrading the sector in
 the face of stiff international competition.

Economy

 Overview: Sierra Leone has substantial mineral, agricultural, and
 fishery resources, but the economic and social infrastructure is not
 well developed. Agriculture generates about 40% of GDP and employs
 about two-thirds of the working population, with subsistence
 agriculture dominating the sector. Manufacturing, which accounts for
 roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw materials
 and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining
 provides an important source of hard currency. Since 1990, the
 government has been able to meet its IMF- and World Bank-mandated
 stabilization targets, holding down fiscal deficits, increasing
 foreign exchange reserves, and retiring much of its domestic debt -
 but at a steep cost in terms of capital investments and social
 spending. Moreover, the economic infrastructure has nearly collapsed
 due to neglect and war-related disruptions in the mining and
 agricultural export sectors. The continuing civil war in Liberia has
 led to a large influx of refugees, who place additional burdens on
 Sierra Leon's fragile economy.

Economy

 Overview: Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong
 service and manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading
 links derived from its entrepot history. The economy registered 10.1%
 growth in 1994, with prospects for 7.5%-8.5% growth in 1995. In 1994,
 the manufacturing and financial and business services sectors have led
 economic growth. Exports boomed, led by the electronics sector,
 particularly US demand for disk drives. Rising labor costs continue to
 be a threat to Singapore's competitiveness, but there are indications
 that productivity is keeping up. In applied technology, per capita
 output, investment, and labor discipline, Singapore has key attributes
 of a developed country.

Economy

 Overview: In 1994 macroeconomic performance improved steadily but
 privatization progressed only in fits and starts. Most of Slovakia's
 IMF-approved targets were met by an interim government that lasted 9
 months. Annual inflation fell from 23% in 1993 to 12%; unemployment at
 14.6% was still well below forecasts of 17%; and the budget deficit
 was around half that in 1993. Slovakia's nearly $200 million trade
 surplus also compares favorably with a more than $800 million deficit
 in 1993. Furthermore, after contracting almost 25% in the three years
 following 1990, GDP grew 4.3% in 1994, according to official
 statistics. Bratislava in June qualified for a $254 million IMF
 stand-by loan and the second $90 million tranche of its Systemic
 Transformation Facility and, in December, received approval for a
 European Union loan worth about $160 million. By the end of September
 1994, the Central Bank's foreign currency reserves had tripled since
 the end of 1993. Slovakia continued to have difficulty attracting
 foreign investment, however, because of perceived political
 instability and halting progress in privatization. The interim
 government prepared property worth nearly $2 billion for the second
 wave of coupon privatization and sold participation in the program to
 over 80% of Slovakia's eligible citizens. Parties controlling the new
 Parliament in November 1994, however, put the second wave of coupon
 privatization on hold and suspended sales of 38 firms until the new
 government could evaluate the interim government's decisions in early
 1995. The new government's targets for 1995 include GDP growth of 3%,
 inflation of 8%-10%, unemployment of 15%, and a budget deficit under
 3% of GDP. Continuing economic recovery in western Europe should boost
 Slovak exports and production, but Slovakia's image with foreign
 creditors and investors could suffer setbacks in 1995 if progress on
 privatization stalls or budget deficits mount beyond IMF-recommended
 levels.

Economy

 Overview: Slovenia appears to be making a solid economic recovery,
 fulfilling the promise it showed at the time of Yugoslavia's breakup.
 It was by far the most prosperous of the former Yugoslav republics,
 with a per capita income more than twice the national average. It also
 benefited from strong ties to Western Europe and suffered
 comparatively small physical damage in the dismemberment process. The
 beginning was difficult, however. Real GDP fell 15% during 1991-92,
 while inflation jumped to 247% in 1991 and unemployment topped 8% -
 nearly three times the 1989 level. The turning point came in 1993 when
 real GDP grew 1%, unemployment leveled off at about 9%, and inflation
 slowed dramatically to 23%. In 1994, the rate of growth of GDP rose to
 4%, unemployment remained stable, and inflation dropped to 20%. This
 was accomplished, moreover, without balance-of-payments problems. The
 government gets generally good economic marks from foreign observers,
 particularly with regard to fiscal policy - the budget deficit in 1994
 was only about 1% of GDP, following several years of small surpluses.
 Prospects for 1995 appear good, with economic growth expected to
 remain strong while unemployment and inflation may decline slightly.
 Privatization, sluggish to date, is expected to pick up in 1995.

Economy

 Overview: The bulk of the population depend on subsistence
 agriculture, fishing, and forestry for at least part of their
 livelihood. Most manufactured goods and petroleum products must be
 imported. The islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such
 as lead, zinc, nickel, and gold. The economy suffered from a severe
 cyclone in mid-1986 that caused widespread damage to the
 infrastructure. In 1993, the government was working with the IMF to
 develop a structural adjustment program to address the country's
 fiscal deficit.

Economy

 Overview: One of the world's poorest and least developed countries,
 Somalia has few resources. Moreover, much of the economy has been
 devastated by the civil war. Agriculture is the most important sector,
 with livestock accounting for about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export
 earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for
 their livelihood make up about 70% of the population. Crop production
 generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% of the work force. The
 main export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for
 the domestic market. The small industrial sector is based on the
 processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10% of
 GDP; most facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife.
 The greatly increased political turmoil of 1991-93 has resulted in a
 substantial drop in agricultural output, with widespread famine. In
 1994 economic conditions stabilized in the countryside but may turn
 worse in 1995 if civil strife intensifies after the UN withdrawal.

Economy

 Overview: Many of the white one-seventh of the South African
 population enjoy incomes, material comforts, and health and
 educational standards equal to those of Western Europe. In contrast,
 most of the remaining population suffers from the poverty patterns of
 the Third World, including unemployment and lack of job skills. The
 main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral resources, which
 provide two-thirds of exports. Economic developments for the remainder
 of the 1990s will be driven largely by the new government's attempts
 to improve black living conditions, to set the country on an
 aggressive export-led growth path, and to cut back the enormous
 numbers of unemployed. The economy in recent years has absorbed less
 than 5% of the more than 300,000 workers entering the labor force
 annually. Local economists estimate that the economy must grow between
 5% and 6% in real terms annually to absorb all of the new entrants,
 much less reduce the accumulated total.

Economy

 Overview: Spain, with a per capita output approximately two-thirds
 that of the four leading economies of Western Europe, has shared with
 these countries the recession of the early 1990s and the upturn of
 their economic fortunes in 1994. But whereas unemployment in these
 countries has hovered just above 10%, Spain has been forced to cope
 with a 25% unemployment rate. Continued political turmoil has
 complicated the establishment of stable government policies toward
 budgetary restraint, interest rates, labor law reform, and Spain's
 role in the evolving economic integration of Western Europe. Because
 the recession has been so deep, the growth in industrial output,
 tourism, and other sectors in 1994, while welcome, falls far short of
 the growth required to bring unemployment down to, say, 10%. The
 recovery in the economies of major trade partners, the comparatively
 low inflation rate, lower interest rates, and prospects in the tourist
 sector suggest that Spain can make substantial progress in 1995.

Economy

 Overview: Industry - dominated by the fast-growing apparel industry -
 has surpassed agriculture as the main source of export earnings and
 accounts for over 16% of GDP. The economy has been plagued by high
 rates of unemployment since the late 1970s. Economic growth, which has
 been depressed by ethnic unrest, accelerated in 1991-94 as domestic
 conditions began to improve and conditions for foreign investment
 brightened. Currently, however, the new government's emphasis on
 populist measures has clouded Sri Lanka's economic prospects.

Economy

 Overview: Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political
 instability, adverse weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances
 from abroad, and counterproductive economic policies. Governmental
 entities account for more than 70% of new investment. The private
 sector's main areas of activity are agriculture and trading, with most
 private industrial investment predating 1980. Agriculture employs 80%
 of the work force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items.
 Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, attributable
 largely to declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita
 income and consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages
 continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary
 Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because
 of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked
 on promised reforms in 1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from
 the Fund. To avoid expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make payments on its
 arrears to the Fund, liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies.
 These measures have been partially implemented. The government's
 continued prosecution of the civil war and its growing international
 isolation led to a further deterioration of the nonagricultural
 sectors of the economy during 1994. Agriculture, on the other hand,
 after several disappointing years, enjoyed a bumper fall harvest in
 1994; its strong performance produced an overall growth rate in GDP of
 perhaps 7%.

 continues to finance deficit spending with monetary emissions. As a
 result, high inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market
 activity, and hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.

 Overview: Coal mining is the major economic activity on Svalbard. By
 treaty (9 February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have
 equal rights to exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian
 regulation. Although US, UK, Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have
 mined in the past, the only companies still mining are Norwegian and
 Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are essentially company towns.
 The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs nearly 60% of the
 Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local services,
 and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some
 trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.

Economy

 Overview: The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which
 occupies more than 60% of the population and contributes nearly 25% to
 GDP. Manufacturing, which includes a number of agroprocessing
 factories, accounts for another quarter of GDP. Mining has declined in
 importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted
 by 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for asbestos. Exports of
 sugar and forestry products are the main earners of hard currency.
 Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with Mozambique,
 Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it receives
 90% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.
 Remittances from Swazi workers in South African mines may supplement
 domestically produced income by as much as 20%.

Economy

 Overview: Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World
 War I through World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard
 of living under a mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive
 welfare benefits. It has a modern distribution system, excellent
 internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force.
 Timber, hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an
 economy that is heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned
 firms account for about 90% of industrial output, of which the
 engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and exports. In 1990,
 agriculture accounted for only 1.2% of GDP and 1.9% of the jobs,
 Sweden being about 50% sufficient in most products. In the last few
 years, however, this extraordinarily favorable picture has been
 clouded by inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual loss of
 competitiveness in international markets. Although Prime Minister
 BILDT's center-right minority coalition had hoped to charge ahead with
 free-market-oriented reforms, a skyrocketing budget deficit - about
 14% of GDP in FY93/94 projections - and record unemployment have
 forestalled many of the plans. Unemployment in 1994 is estimated at
 around 9% with another 5% in job training. Continued heavy foreign
 exchange speculation forced the government to cooperate in late 1992
 with the opposition Social Democrats on two crisis packages - one a
 severe austerity pact and the other a program to spur industrial
 competitiveness - which basically set economic policy through 1997. In
 November 1992, Sweden broke its tie to the EC's ECU, and the krona has
 since depreciated about 25% against the dollar. The boost in export
 competitiveness from the depreciation helped lift Sweden out of its
 3-year recession. To curb the budget deficit and bolster confidence in
 the economy, the new Social Democratic government is proposing cuts in
 welfare benefits, subsidies, defense, and foreign aid. Sweden has
 harmonized its economic policies with those of the EU, which it joined
 at the start of 1995.

Economy

 Overview: Switzerland's economy - one of the most prosperous and
 stable in the world - is nonetheless undergoing a stressful adjustment
 after both the inflationary boom of the late 1980s and the
 electorate's rejection of membership in the European Economic Area
 (EEA) in 1992. So far the decision to remain outside the European
 single market structure does not appear to have harmed Swiss
 interests. In December 1994, the Swiss began bilateral negotiations
 with the EU aimed at establishing closer ties in areas of mutual
 interest and progressing toward the free circulation of persons,
 goods, capital, and services between the two parties. The Swiss
 emerged from a three-year recession in mid-1993 and posted 1.8% GDP
 growth in 1994. The Swiss central bank's tight monetary policies
 brought inflation down from about 4% in 1992 to just under 1% in 1994.
 Unemployment has fallen slightly from 5.1% in 1993 to 4.7% in 1994.
 Swiss per capita output, living standards, education, and health care
 remain unsurpassed in Europe. The country has few mineral resources,
 but its spectacular natural beauty sustains a substantial tourism
 industry.

Economy

 Overview: In 1990-93 Syria's state-dominated Ba'thist economy
 benefited from the Gulf war, increased oil production, good weather,
 and economic deregulation. Economic growth averaged roughly 10%. The
 Gulf war provided Syria an aid windfall of nearly $5 billion dollars
 from Arab, European, and Japanese donors. However, the benefits of the
 1990-93 boom were not evenly distributed and the gap between rich and
 poor is widening. A nationwide financial scandal and increasing
 inflation were accompanied by a decline in GDP growth to 4% in 1994.
 For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled with a large number
 of poorly performing public sector firms, and industrial productivity
 remains to be improved. Oil production is likely to fall off
 dramatically by the end of the decade. Unemployment will become a
 problem for the government when the more than 60% of the population
 under the age of 20 enter the labor force.

Economy

 Overview: Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable
 government guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial
 government ownership of some large banks and industrial firms. Real
 growth in GNP has averaged about 9% a year during the past three
 decades. Export growth has been even faster and has provided the
 impetus for industrialization. Inflation and unemployment are
 remarkably low. Agriculture contributes about 4% to GDP, down from 35%
 in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13 among major trading
 countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being
 replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive industries.
 Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand, Indonesia, the
 Philippines, Malaysia, and Vietnam. The tightening of labor markets
 has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.

TAJIKISTAN

 Note--Tajikistan has experienced three changes of government since it
 gained independence in September 1991. The current president, Emomali
 RAKHMONOV, was elected to the presidency in November 1994, yet has
 been in power since 1992. The country is suffering through its third
 year of a civil war, with no clear end in sight. Underlying the
 conflict are deeply-rooted regional and clan-based animosities that
 pit a government consisting of people primarily from the Kulob
 (Kulyab), Khujand (Leninabad), and Hisor (Hissar) regions against a
 secular and Islamic-led opposition from the Gharm, Gorno-Badakhshan,
 and Qurghonteppa (Kurgan-Tyube) regions. Government and opposition
 representatives have held periodic rounds of UN-mediated peace talks
 and agreed in September 1994 to a cease-fire. Russian-led peacekeeping
 troops are deployed throughout the country, and Russian border guards
 are stationed along the Tajik-Afghan border.

Economy

 Overview: Tajikistan had the next-to-lowest per capita GDP in the
 former USSR, the highest rate of population growth, and an extremely
 low standard of living. Agriculture dominates the economy, cotton
 being the most important crop. Mineral resources, varied but limited
 in amount, include silver, gold, uranium, and tungsten. Industry is
 limited to a large aluminum plant, hydropower facilities, and small
 obsolete factories mostly in light industry and food processing. The
 Tajik economy has been gravely weakened by three years of civil war
 and by the loss of subsidies and markets for its products, which has
 left Tajikistan dependent on Russia and Uzbekistan and on
 international humanitarian assistance for much of its basic
 subsistence needs. Moreover, constant political turmoil and the
 continued dominance by former Communist officials have impeded the
 introduction of meaningful economic reforms. In the meantime,
 Tajikistan's efforts to adopt the Russian ruble as its domestic
 currency despite Russia's unwillingness to supply sufficient rubles
 left the country in a severe monetary crisis throughout 1994, keeping
 inflation low but leaving workers and pensioners unpaid for months at
 a time. The government has announced plans to introduce its own
 currency in 1995 to help resolve the problem.

 National product: GDP - purchasing power parity - $8.5 billion (1994

Economy

 Overview: Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The
 economy is heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about
 58% of GDP, provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work
 force. Topography and climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated
 crops to only 5% of the land area. Industry accounts for 8% of GDP and
 is mainly limited to processing agricultural products and light
 consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced in mid-1986
 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
 financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank,
 the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided
 funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure.
 Growth in 1991-94 has featured a pickup in industrial production and a
 substantial increase in output of minerals, led by gold. Recent
 banking reforms have helped increase private sector growth and
 investment.

Economy

 Overview: Thailand's economy recovered rapidly from the political
 unrest in May 1992 to post an impressive 7.5% growth rate for the
 year, 7.8% in 1993, and 8% in 1994. One of the more advanced
 developing countries in Asia, Thailand depends on exports of
 manufactures and the development of the service sector to fuel the
 country's rapid growth. Much of Thailand's recent imports have been
 for capital equipment, suggesting that the export sector is poised for
 further growth. With foreign investment slowing, Bangkok is working to
 increase the generation of domestic capital. Prime Minister CHUAN's
 government - Thailand's fifth government in less than three years - is
 pledged to continue Bangkok's probusiness policies, and the return of
 a democratically elected government has improved business confidence.
 Even so, CHUAN must overcome divisions within his ruling coalition to
 complete much needed infrastructure development programs if Thailand
 is to remain an attractive place for business investment. Over the
 longer-term, Bangkok must produce more college graduates with
 technical training and upgrade workers' skills to continue its rapid
 economic development.

Economy

 Overview: The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture,
 which accounts for about half of GDP and provides employment for 80%
 of the labor force. Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee,
 and cotton, which together generate about 30% of total export
 earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in basic foodstuffs when harvests
 are normal. In the industrial sector phosphate mining is by far the
 most important activity, although it has suffered from the collapse of
 world phosphate prices and increased foreign competition. Togo serves
 as a regional commercial and trade center. The government's
 decade-long IMF and World Bank supported effort to implement economic
 reform measures to encourage foreign investment and bring revenues in
 line with expenditures has stalled. Political unrest, including
 private and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, has
 jeopardized the reform program, shrunk the tax base, and disrupted
 vital economic activity. Although strikes had ended in 1994, political
 unrest and lack of funds prevented the government from taking
 advantage of the 50% currency devaluation of January 1994. Resumption
 of World Bank and IMF flows will depend on implementation of several
 controversial moves toward privatization and on downsizing the
 military, on which the regime depends to stay in power.

Economy

 Overview: The economy's base is agriculture, which employs about 70%
 of the labor force and contributes 40% to GDP. Squash, coconuts,
 bananas, and vanilla beans are the main crops, and agricultural
 exports make up two-thirds of total exports. The country must import a
 high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The
 manufacturing sector accounts for only 11% of GDP. Tourism is the
 primary source of hard currency earnings, but the country also remains
 dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to offset its trade
 deficit. The economy continued to grow in 1993-94 largely because of a
 rise in squash exports, increased aid flows, and several large
 construction projects. The government is now turning its attention to
 further development of the private sector and the reduction of the
 budget deficit.

Economy

 Overview: Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important agricultural,
 mining, energy, tourism, and manufacturing sectors. Detailed
 governmental control of economic affairs has gradually lessened over
 the past decade, including increasing privatization of trade and
 commerce, simplification of the tax structure, and a cautious approach
 to debt. Real growth has averaged roughly 5% in 1991-94, and inflation
 has been moderate. Growth in tourism and IMF support have been key
 elements in this solid record. Further privatization and further
 improvements in government administrative efficiency are among the
 challenges for the future.

Economy

 Overview: In early 1995, after an impressive economic performance
 through most of the 1980s, Turkey continues to suffer through its most
 damaging economic crisis in the last 15 years. Sparked by the
 downgrading in January 1994 of Turkey's international credit rating by
 two US credit rating agencies, the crisis stems from years of loose
 fiscal and monetary policies that had exacerbated inflation and
 allowed the public debt, money supply, and current account deficit to
 explode. In April 1994, Prime Minister CILLER introduced an austerity
 package aimed at restoring domestic and international confidence in
 her fragile coalition government. Three months later the IMF endorsed
 the program, paving the way for a $740 million IMF standby loan.
 Although the economy showed signs of improvement following the
 stabilization measures, CILLER has been unable to overcome the
 political obstacles to tough structural reforms necessary for
 sustained, longer-term growth. As a consequence, the economy is
 suffering the worst of both worlds: at the end of 1994, inflation hit
 a record 126% (annual rate), and real GDP dropped an estimated 5% for
 the year as a whole, the worst decline in Turkey's post-war history.
 At the same time, the government missed key 1994 targets stipulated in
 the IMF agreement: the budget deficit is estimated to have overshot
 the government's goal by 47%; the total public sector borrowing
 requirement likely reached 10%-12% of GDP, rather than 8.5% called for
 in the program; and the Turkish lira's value fell 5% to 7% more than
 expected. The unprecedented effort by the Kurdistan Workers' Party
 (PKK) to raise the economic costs of its insurgency against the
 Turkish state is adding to Turkey's economic problems. Attacks against
 tourists have jeopardized tourist revenues, which account for about 3%
 of GDP, while economic activity in southeastern Turkey, where most of
 the violence occurs, has dropped considerably. Turkish officials are
 now negotiating a new letter of intent with the IMF that will
 stipulate more realistic macroeconomic goals for 1995 and allow the
 release of remaining funds of the standby agreement.

 oil resources. Half its irrigated land is planted in cotton making it
 the world's tenth largest producer. It also has the world's fifth
 largest reserves of natural gas and significant oil resources. Until
 the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had experienced less economic disruption
 than other former Soviet states because its economy received a boost
 from higher prices for oil and gas and a sharp increase in hard
 currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's refusal to export Turkmen gas to
 hard currency markets and mounting debts of its major customers in the
 former USSR for gas deliveries contributed to a sharp fall in
 industrial production and caused the budget to shift from a surplus to
 a slight deficit. Furthermore, with an authoritarian ex-Communist
 regime in power and a tribally-based social structure, Turkmenistan
 has taken a cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas
 and cotton sales to sustain its inefficient economy. With the onset of
 economic hard times, even cautious moves toward economic restructuring
 and privatization have slowed down. For 1995, Turkmenistan will face
 continuing constraints on its earnings because of its customers'
 inability to pay for their gas and a low average cotton crop in 1994.
 Turkmenistan is working hard to open new gas export channels through
 Iran and Turkey, but these may take many years to realize.

Economy

 Overview: Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls
 with poor soil. The country has no known mineral resources and few
 exports. Subsistence farming and fishing are the primary economic
 activities. The islands are too small and too remote for development
 of a tourist industry. Government revenues largely come from the sale
 of stamps and coins and worker remittances. Substantial income is
 received annually from an international trust fund established in 1987
 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported also by Japan and South
 Korea.

Economy

 Overview: Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile
 soils, regular rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and
 cobalt. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy,
 employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export crop
 and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the
 government - with the support of foreign countries and international
 agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by
 undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export crops,
 increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service
 wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation
 and boosting production and export earnings. In 1990-94, the economy
 turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
 rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production
 and exports, and gradually improving domestic security. The economy
 again prospered in 1994 with rapid growth, low inflation, growing
 foreign investment, a trimmed bureaucracy, and the continued return of
 exiled Indian-Ugandan entrepreneurs.

Economy

 Overview: After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the
 most important economic component of the former Soviet Union,
 producing more than three times the output of the next-ranking
 republic. Its fertile black soil generated more than one-fourth of
 Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial
 quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to other republics.
 Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw
 materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the
 former USSR. In early 1992, the Ukrainian government liberalized most
 prices and erected a legal framework for privatization, but widespread
 resistance to reform within the government and the legislature soon
 stalled reform efforts and led to some backtracking. Loose monetary
 and fiscal policies pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels in
 late 1993. Greater monetary and fiscal restraint lowered inflation in
 1994, but also contributed to an accelerated decline in industrial
 output. Since his election in July 1994, President KUCHMA has
 developed - and parliament has approved - a comprehensive economic
 reform program, maintained financial discipline, and reduced state
 controls over prices, the exchange rate, and foreign trade.
 Implementation of KUCHMA's economic agenda will encounter considerable
 resistance from parliament, entrenched bureaucrats, and industrial
 interests and will contribute to further declines in output and rising
 unemployment which will sorely test the government's ability to stay
 the course on reform in 1995.

Economy

 Overview: The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's highest
 incomes per capita and with a sizable annual trade surplus. Its wealth
 is based on oil and gas output (about 40% of GDP), and the fortunes of
 the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities. Since
 1973, the UAE has undergone a profound transformation from an
 impoverished region of small desert principalities to a modern state
 with a high standard of living. At present levels of production, crude
 oil reserves should last for over 100 years. Although much stronger
 economically than most Gulf states, the UAE faces similar problems
 with weak international oil prices and the pressures for cuts in OPEC
 oil production quotas. The UAE government is encouraging increased
 privatization within the economy.

Economy

 Overview: The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and
 financial centers, and its economy ranks among the four largest in
 Western Europe. The economy is essentially capitalistic; over the past
 13 years the ruling Tories have greatly reduced public ownership and
 contained the growth of social welfare programs. Agriculture is
 intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European standards,
 producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the labor force. The
 UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves, and primary energy
 production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
 industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and
 business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP
 while industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only
 25% of the work force and generating only 21% of GDP. The economy
 registered 4.2% GDP growth in 1994, its fastest annual rate for six
 years. Exports and manufacturing output are the primary engines of
 growth. Unemployment is gradually falling. Inflation is at the lowest
 level in 27 years, but British monetary authorities raised interest
 rates to 6.25% in 1994 in a preemptive strike on emerging inflationary
 pressures such as higher taxes and rising manufacturing costs. The
 combination of a buoyant economy and fiscal tightening is projected to
 trim the FY94/95 budget shortfall to about $50 billion - down from
 about $75 billion in FY93/94. The major economic policy question for
 Britain in the 1990s is the terms on which it participates in the
 financial and economic integration of Europe.

@United States:Geography

 Location: North America, bordering both the North Atlantic Ocean and
 the North Pacific Ocean, between Canada and Mexico

 Map references: North America

 Area:
 total area: 9,372,610 sq km
 land area: 9,166,600 sq km
 comparative area: about half the size of Russia; about three-tenths
 the size of Africa; about one-half the size of South America (or
 slightly larger than Brazil); slightly smaller than China; about two
 and one-half times the size of Western Europe
 note: includes only the 50 states and District of Columbia

 Land boundaries: total 12,248 km, Canada 8,893 km (including 2,477 km
 with Alaska), Cuba 29 km (US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay), Mexico

 claims Navassa Island; US has made no territorial claim in Antarctica
 (but has reserved the right to do so) and does not recognize the
 claims of any other nation; Republic of Marshall Islands claims Wake
 Island

 Climate: mostly temperate, but tropical in Hawaii and Florida and
 arctic in Alaska, semiarid in the great plains west of the Mississippi
 River and arid in the Great Basin of the southwest; low winter
 temperatures in the northwest are ameliorated occasionally in January
 and February by warm chinook winds from the eastern slopes of the
 Rocky Mountains

 from the burning of fossil fuels; water pollution from runoff of
 pesticides and fertilizers; very limited natural fresh water resources
 in much of the western part of the country require careful management;
 desertification
 natural hazards: tsunamis, volcanoes, and earthquake activity around
 Pacific Basin; hurricanes along the Atlantic coast; tornadoes in the
 midwest; mudslides in California; forest fires in the west; flooding;
 permafrost in northern Alaska is a major impediment to development

Economy

 Overview: The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically
 advanced economy in the world, with a per capita GDP of $25,850, the
 largest among major industrial nations. The economy is market oriented
 with most decisions made by private individuals and business firms and
 with government purchases of goods and services made predominantly in
 the marketplace. In 1989 the economy enjoyed its seventh successive
 year of substantial growth, the longest in peacetime history. The
 expansion featured moderation in wage and consumer price increases and
 a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of the labor force. In
 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a combination of
 factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates, Iraq's
 invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and
 a general decline in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output
 fell by 0.6%, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved
 premature. Growth picked up to 2.3% in 1992 and to 3.1% in 1993.
 Unemployment, however, declined only gradually, the increase in GDP
 being mainly attributable to gains in output per worker. The year 1994
 witnessed a solid 4% gain in real output, a low inflation rate of
 2.6%, and a drop in unemployment below 6%. The capture of both houses
 of Congress by the Republicans in the elections of 8 November 1994
 means substantial changes are likely in US economic policy, including
 changes in the ways the US will address its major economic problems in
 1995-96. These problems include inadequate investment in economic
 infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an aging population,
 and sizable budget and trade deficits.

Economy

 Overview: Uruguay's economy is a small one with favorable climate,
 good soils, and substantial hydropower potential. Economic development
 has been restrained in recent years by excessive government regulation
 of economic detail and 40% to 130% inflation. Although the GDP growth
 rate slowed in 1993 to 1.7%, following a healthy expansion to 7.5% in
 1992, it rebounded in 1994 to an estimated 4%, spurred mostly by
 increasing agricultural and other exports and a surprise reversal of
 the downward trend in industrial production. In a major step toward
 regional economic cooperation, Uruguay confirmed its commitment to the
 Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) customs union by implementing
 MERCOSUR's common external tariff on most tradables on 1 January 1995.
 Inflation in 1994 declined for the third consecutive year, yet, at
 44%, it remains the highest in the region; analysts predict that the
 expanding fiscal deficit and wage indexation will force the inflation
 rate back toward the 50% mark in 1995.

Economy

 Overview: Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 10%
 consists of intensely cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It is one
 of the poorest states of the former USSR with 60% of its population
 living in overpopulated rural communities. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan is
 the world's third largest cotton exporter, a major producer of gold
 and natural gas, and a regionally significant producer of chemicals
 and machinery. Since independence, the government has sought to prop
 up the Soviet-style command economy with subsidies and tight controls
 on prices and production. Such policies have buffered the economy from
 the sharp declines in output and high inflation experienced by many
 other former Soviet republics. They had become increasingly
 unsustainable, however, as inflation moves along at 14% per month and
 as Russia has forced the Uzbek government to introduce its own
 currency. Faced with mounting economic problems, the government has
 begun to move on a reform agenda and cooperate with international
 financial institutions, announced an acceleration of privatization,
 and stepped up efforts to attract foreign investors. Nevertheless, the
 regime is likely to find it difficult to sustain its drive for
 economic reform.

Economy

 Overview: Despite efforts to broaden the base of the economy,
 petroleum continues to play a dominant role. In 1994, as GDP declined
 3.3%, the oil sector - which accounts for 24% of the total - enjoyed a
 6% expansion, provided 45% of the budget revenues, and generated 70%
 of the export earnings. President CALDERA, who assumed office in
 February 1994, has used an interventionist, reactive approach to
 managing the economy, instituting price and foreign exchange controls
 in mid-year to slow inflation and stop the loss of foreign exchange
 reserves. The government claims it will remove these controls once
 inflationary pressures abate, but the $8 billion bailout of the
 banking sector in 1994 has made it difficult for the government to
 make good on its promise. Economic controls, coupled with political
 uncertainty driven by recurrent coup rumors, continue to deter foreign
 and domestic investment; private forecasters see the recession
 persisting for a third year in 1995.

Economy

 Overview: Vietnam has made significant progress in recent years moving
 away from the planned economic model toward a more effective
 market-based economic system. Most prices are now fully decontrolled,
 and the Vietnamese currency has been effectively devalued and floated
 at world market rates. In addition, the scope for private sector
 activity has been expanded, primarily through decollectivization of
 the agricultural sector and introduction of laws giving legal
 recognition to private business. Nearly three-quarters of export
 earnings are generated by only two commodities, rice and crude oil.
 Led by industry and construction, the economy did well in 1993 and
 1994 with output rising 7% and 9% respectively. However, the
 industrial sector remains burdened by noncompetitive state-owned
 enterprises the government is unwilling or unable to privatize.
 Unemployment looms as a serious problem with roughly 20% of the work
 force without jobs and with population growth swelling the ranks of
 the labor force yearly.

@West Bank:Government

 Note: Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim
 Self-Government Arragements ("the DOP"), Israel agreed to transfer
 certain powers and responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, and
 subsequently to an elected Palestinian Council, as part of interim
 self-governing arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A
 transfer of powers and responsibilities for the Gaza Strip and Jericho
 has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 May 1994 Cairo Agreement
 on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. A transfer of powers and
 responsibilities in certain spheres for the rest of the West Bank has
 taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 29 August 1994 Agreement on
 Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities. The DOP provides
 that Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period
 for external security and for internal security and public order of
 settlements and Israelis. Final status is to be determined through
 direct negotiations within five years.

Economy

 Overview: Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by
 Israeli military administration and the effects of the Palestinian
 uprising (intifadah). Industries using advanced technology or
 requiring sizable investment have been discouraged by a lack of local
 capital and restrictive Israeli policies. Capital investment consists
 largely of residential housing, not productive assets that would
 enable local Palestinian firms to compete with Israeli industry. GDP
 has been substantially supplemented by remittances of workers employed
 in Israel and Persian Gulf states. Such transfers from the Gulf
 dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of the
 Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West Bank,
 increasing unemployment, and export revenues have dropped because of
 the decline of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures
 to curtail the intifadah also have added to unemployment and lowered
 living standards. The area's economic situation has worsened since
 Israel's partial closure of the territories in 1993.

Economy

 Overview: Agriculture employs more than half of the labor force,
 contributes 50% to GDP, and furnishes 90% of exports. The bulk of
 export earnings comes from the sale of coconut oil and copra. The
 economy depends on emigrant remittances and foreign aid to support a
 level of imports much greater than export earnings. Tourism has become
 the most important growth industry. The economy continued to falter in
 1994, as remittances and tourist earnings remained low. Production of
 taro, the primary food export crop, has dropped 97% since a fungal
 disease struck the crop in 1993. The rapid growth in 1994 of the giant
 African snail population in Western Samoa is also threatening the
 country's basic food crops, such as bananas and coconuts.

Economy

 Overview: Led by recovery in Western Europe and strong performances by
 the US, Canada, and key Third World countries, real global output -
 gross world product (GWP) - rose 3% in 1994 compared with 2% in 1993.
 Results varied widely among regions and countries. Average growth of
 3% in the GDP of industrialized countries (60% of GWP in 1994) and
 average growth of 6% in the GDP of less developed countries (34% of
 GWP) were partly offset by a further 11% drop in the GDP of the former
 USSR/Eastern Europe area (now only 6% of GWP). With the notable
 exception of Japan at 2.9%, unemployment was typically 5%-12% in the
 industrial world. The US accounted for 22% of GWP in 1994; Western
 Europe accounted for another 22%; and Japan accounted for 8%. These
 are the three "economic superpowers" which are presumably destined to
 compete for mastery in international markets on into the 21st century.
 As for the less developed countries, China, India, and the Four
 Dragons - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore - once again
 posted records of 5% growth or better; however, many other countries,
 especially in Africa, continued to suffer from drought, rapid
 population growth, inflation, and civil strife. Central Europe made
 considerable progress in moving toward "market-friendly" economies,
 whereas the 15 ex-Soviet countries (with the notable exceptions of the
 three Baltic states) typically experienced further declines in output,
 sometimes as high as 30%. Externally, the nation-state, as a bedrock
 economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
 international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology.
 Internally, the central government in a number of cases is losing
 control over resources as separatist regional movements - typically
 based on ethnicity - gain momentum, e.g., in the successor states of
 the former Soviet Union, in the former Yugoslavia, and in India. In
 Western Europe, governments face the difficult political problem of
 channeling resources away from welfare programs in order to increase
 investment and strengthen incentives to seek employment. The addition
 of nearly 100 million people each year to an already overcrowded globe
 is exacerbating the problems of pollution, desertification,
 underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of their own internal
 problems, the industrialized countries have inadequate resources to
 deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at least
 from the economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized.
 (For the specific economic problems of each country, see the
 individual country entries in this volume.)

 National product: GWP (gross world product) - purchasing power parity
 - $30.7 trillion (1994 est.)

 National product real growth rate: 3.2% (1994 est.)

 National product per capita: $5,400 (1994 est.)

 Inflation rate (consumer prices):
 all countries: 25%
 developed countries: 5%
 developing countries: 50% (1994 est.)
 note: national inflation rates vary widely in individual cases, from
 stable prices to hyperinflation

 Unemployment rate: 30% combined unemployment and underemployment in
 many non-industrialized countries; developed countries typically
 5%-12% unemployment

 Exports: $4 trillion (f.o.b., 1994 est.)

 Imports: $4.1 trillion (c.i.f., 1994 est.)
 commodities: the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and

 External debt: $1 trillion for less developed countries (1993 est.)

 Industrial production: growth rate 5% (1994 est.)

 Electricity:
 capacity: 2,773,000,000 kW
 production: 11.601 trillion kWh
 consumption per capita: 1,937 kWh (1993)

 Industries: industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of
 technology, especially in computers, robotics, telecommunications, and
 medicines and medical equipment; most of these advances take place in
 OECD nations; only a small portion of non-OECD countries have
 succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these technological forces, and the
 technological gap between the industrial nations and the
 less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid development of
 new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating already
 grim environmental problems

 Agriculture: the production of major food crops has increased
 substantially in the last 20 years; the annual production of cereals,
 for instance, has risen by 50%, from about 1.2 billion metric tons to
 about 1.8 billion metric tons; production increases have resulted
 mainly from increased yields rather than increases in planted areas;
 while global production is sufficient for aggregate demand, about
 one-fifth of the world's population remains malnourished, primarily
 because local production cannot adequately provide for large and
 rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for food
 imports; conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
 recent years has intensified the consequences of overpopulation

Economy

 Overview: Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of
 a united Yemen, the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port
 facilities, is the economic and commercial capital. Future economic
 development depends heavily on Western-assisted development of the
 country's moderate oil resources. Former South Yemen's willingness to
 merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet economic
 support. The low level of domestic industry and agriculture has made
 northern Yemen dependent on imports for practically all of its
 essential needs. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern
 Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for export crops -
 cotton, fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to growing a
 shrub called qat, whose leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect
 by Yemenis and which has no significant export market. Economic growth
 in former South Yemen has been constrained by a lack of incentives,
 partly stemming from centralized control over production decisions,
 investment allocation, and import choices. Yemen's large trade
 deficits have been compensated for by remittances from Yemenis working
 abroad and by foreign aid. Since the Gulf crisis, remittances have
 dropped substantially. Growth in 1994-95 is constrained by low oil
 prices, rapid inflation, and political deadlock that are causing a
 lack of economic cooperation and leadership. However, a peace
 agreement with Saudi Arabia in February 1995 and the expectation of a
 rise in oil prices brighten Yemen's economic prospects.

Economy

 Overview: Zaire's economy has continued to disintegrate although Prime
 Minister KENGO has had some success in slowing the rate of economic
 decline. While meaningful economic figures are difficult to come by,
 Zaire's hyperinflation, chronic large government deficits, and
 plunging mineral production have made the country one of the world's
 poorest. Most formal transactions are conducted in hard currency as
 indigenous bank notes have lost almost all value, and a barter economy
 now flourishes in all but the largest cities. Most individuals and
 families hang on grimly through subsistence farming and petty trade.
 The government has not been able to meet its financial obligations to
 the International Monetary Fund or put in place the financial measures
 advocated by the IMF. Although short-term prospects for improvement
 are dim, improved political stability would boost Zaire's long-term
 potential to effectively exploit its vast wealth of mineral and
 agricultural resources.

Economy

 Overview: Prior to 1993 the economy had been in decline for more than
 a decade with falling imports and growing foreign debt. Economic
 difficulties stemmed largely from a chronically depressed level of
 copper production and weak copper prices, generally ineffective
 economic policies, and high inflation. An annual population growth of
 3% brought a decline in per capita GDP of 50% over the decade.
 However, economic reforms enacted since 1992 have helped reduce
 inflation, have begun to strengthen the social safety net, and have
 been accompanied by GDP growth at an estimated 6.8% in 1993 and 4% in
 1994. The huge external debt remains a key problem.

Economy

 Overview: Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and
 supplies almost 40% of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on
 agriculture and mining, produces a variety of goods and contributes
 35% to GDP. Mining accounts for only 5% of both GDP and employment,
 but minerals and metals account for about 40% of exports. Severe
 drought caused GDP to drop 8% in 1992, with growth rebounding to 2% in
 1993 and 3.5% in 1994. Despite the lingering effects of the drought on
 economic and social conditions, the government is continuing to push
 its IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program aimed at encouraging
 exports and foreign investment.

APPENDIX C

International Organizations and Groups

 Note: The Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) has
 dissolved and ceases to exist. None of the successor states of the
 former Yugoslavia, including Serbia and Montenegro, have been
 permitted to participate solely on the basis of the membership of the
 former Yugoslavia in the United Nations General Assembly and Economic
 and Social Council and their subsidiary bodies and in various United
 Nations specialized agencies. The United Nations, however, permits the
 seat and nameplate of the SFRY to remain, permits the SFRY mission to
 continue to function, and continues to fly the flag of the former
 Yugoslavia. For a variety of reasons, a number of other organizations
 have not yet taken action with regard to the membership of the former
 Yugoslavia. The World Factbook therefore continues to list Yugoslavia
 under international organizations where the SFRY seat remains or where
 no action has yet been taken.

Metric Interrelationships

 Conversions from a multiple or submultiple to the basic units of
 meters, liters, or grams can be done using the table. For example, to
 convert from kilometers to meters, multiply by 1,000 (9.26 kilometers
 equals 9,260 meters) or to convert from meters to kilometers, multiply
 by 0.001 (9,260 meters equals 9.26 kilometers).
